Hi! I’m Ben Borgers. I’m a high school senior in Boston, and interned at IBM last summer. Next fall, I’m headed to Tufts University to study computer science.

I’m on [twitter](https://twitter.com/benborgers) and [github](https://github.com/benborgers). If you wanna get in touch, I love getting emails: [benborgers@hey.com](mailto:benborgers@hey.com)

I really like doing personal programming projects:

- [Cornflakes](https://cornflakes.app/), a simple and privacy-focused email newsletter tool.
- [Blocks](https://blocks.elk.sh/), an app for my high school’s schedule used by 2,000 students and teachers.
- [Bagel Institute](https://bagel.institute/), tools for more interactive college teaching.
- <strike>[Underline](https://underline.email/), a dead-simple and affordable way to run an email newsletter.</strike>
- [Potion](https://github.com/benborgers/potion), an open-source reverse-engineered API for the Notion note taking app.
- [EMOJICDN](https://emojicdn.elk.sh/), an API for getting images of emojis that serves two million requests per month.

Some past work:

- [Diyi](https://diyiboston.com/), a payment and student management system for an online school in Boston.
- A software engineering internship at IBM Security in the summers of 2019 and 2020, working on a new security offering for enterprise.
- [Rep.ly](https://rep.ly/), where I implemented new features on this public Q&A platform by Dip.
- Built [an app for Sophrosyne](https://sophrosyne.now.sh/), a mental health awareness club.
