## Federalism

<Case
    name="McCulloch v. Maryland"
    bullets={[
        'Does Congress have the Constitutional authority to create a federal bank?',
        'Congress does have the power to charter the bank, under the "necessary and proper" clause of the Constitution.',
        'Maryland has no power to tax the bank, since that would give it the ability to kill the bank.'
    ]}
/>

<Case
    name="United States v. Lopez"
    bullets={[
        'Congress cannot use the commerce clause (the power to regulate interstate commerce) to make possession of a gun in a school zone a federal crime.',
        `Carrying a gun into school isn't an economic activity, so it isn't covered under Congress' power to regulate interstate commerce.`,
        `Not a lot of cases have limited Congress' power under the commerce clause.`
    ]}
/>

*McCulloch v. Maryland* gives Congress more power, *U.S. v. Lopez* gives it less.

/>

<Case
    name="Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District"
    bullets={[
        'Students protested the Vietnam War by wearing black armbands at school.',
        `Supreme Court held that the armbands represented expression that was protected under the first amendment.`,
        `Students retain their free expression rights as long as they don't materially and substantially interfere with the school's operations.`
    ]}
/>

<Case

    bullets={[
        `Can the government stop a newspaper from publishing the Pentagon Papers, arguing that it hurts national security?`,

    name="Schenck v. United States"
    bullets={[

        `Money is speech, and the speech of corporations cannot be silenced.`
    ]}
/>

## Incorporating Liberties into the States

        `Incorporated the Sixth Amendment.`

    ]}
/>

<Case
