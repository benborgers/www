## Section 1: Night

- "We yearned for the future. How did we learn it, that talent for insatiability?" (4).


## Section 2: Shopping

- "We aren't allowed to go [to town] except in twos. This is supposed to be for our protection, though the notion is absurd: we are well protected already. The truth is that she is my spy, as I am hers. If either of us slips through the net because of something that happens on one of our daily walks, the other will be accountable" (19).
- "[Ofglen] may be a real believer, a Handmaid in more than name" (19).
- "It's an event, a small defiance of rule, so small as to be undetectable, but such moments are the rewards I hold out for myself..." (21).
- "Now we walk along the same street, in red pairs, and no man shouts obscenities at us, speaks to us, touches us. No one whistles. There is more than one kind of freedom, said Aunt Lydia. Freedom to and freedom from. In the days of anarchy, it was freedom to. Now you are being given freedom from." (24).
- "It's only the more recent history that offends them" (31).
- "evidence from [one] woman is no longer admissable" (33).
- "Ordinary, said Aunt Lydia, is what you are used to. This may not seem ordinary to you now, but after a time it will. It will become ordinary" (33).


## Section 3: Night

- "I would like to believe this is a story I'm telling... If it's a story I'm telling, then I have control over the ending. Then there will be an ending, to the story, and real life will come after it. I can pick up where I left off" (39).


## Section 4: Waiting Room

- "There are three new bodies on the Wall. One is a priest, still wearing the black cassock. That's been put on him, for the trial..." (43).
    - The hangings are performative, not for some kind of justice.
- "In this house we all envy each other something" (47).
- "Was [the Commander] invading? Was he in my room? I called it _mine_" (49).
- "Nothing changes instantaneously: in a gradually heating bathtub you'd be boiled to death before you knew it" (56).
- "There were stories in the newspapers, of course, corpses in ditches or the woods, bludgeoned to death or mutilated, interfered with, as they used to say, but they were about other women, and the men who did such things were other men. None of them were the men we knew" (56).
- "It's the choice that terrifies me. A way out, a salvation" (61).
- "I avoid looking down at my body, not so much because it's shameful or immodest but because I don't want to see it. I don't want to look at something that determines me so completely" (63).


## Section 5: Nap
- "Each month I watch for blood, fearfully, for when it comes it means failure. I have failed once again to fulfill the expectations of others, which have become my own" (73).
