## Section 1: Night

- "We yearned for the future. How did we learn it, that talent for insatiability?" (4).


## Section 2: Shopping

- "We aren't allowed to go [to town] except in twos. This is supposed to be for our protection, though the notion is absurd: we are well protected already. The truth is that she is my spy, as I am hers. If either of us slips through the net because of something that happens on one of our daily walks, the other will be accountable" (19).
- "[Ofglen] may be a real believer, a Handmaid in more than name" (19).
- "It's an event, a small defiance of rule, so small as to be undetectable, but such moments are the rewards I hold out for myself..." (21).
- "Now we walk along the same street, in red pairs, and no man shouts obscenities at us, speaks to us, touches us. No one whistles. There is more than one kind of freedom, said Aunt Lydia. Freedom to and freedom from. In the days of anarchy, it was freedom to. Now you are being given freedom from." (24).
- "It's only the more recent history that offends them" (31).
- "evidence from [one] woman is no longer admissable" (33).
- "Ordinary, said Aunt Lydia, is what you are used to. This may not seem ordinary to you now, but after a time it will. It will become ordinary" (33).


## Section 3: Night

- "I would like to believe this is a story I'm telling... If it's a story I'm telling, then I have control over the ending. Then there will be an ending, to the story, and real life will come after it. I can pick up where I left off" (39).


## Section 4: Waiting Room

- "There are three new bodies on the Wall. One is a priest, still wearing the black cassock. That's been put on him, for the trial..." (43).
    - The hangings are performative, not for some kind of justice.
- "In this house we all envy each other something" (47).
- "Was [the Commander] invading? Was he in my room? I called it _mine_" (49).
- "Nothing changes instantaneously: in a gradually heating bathtub you'd be boiled to death before you knew it" (56).
- "There were stories in the newspapers, of course, corpses in ditches or the woods, bludgeoned to death or mutilated, interfered with, as they used to say, but they were about other women, and the men who did such things were other men. None of them were the men we knew" (56).
- "It's the choice that terrifies me. A way out, a salvation" (61).
- "I avoid looking down at my body, not so much because it's shameful or immodest but because I don't want to see it. I don't want to look at something that determines me so completely" (63).


## Section 5: Nap
- "Each month I watch for blood, fearfully, for when it comes it means failure. I have failed once again to fulfill the expectations of others, which have become my own" (73).


## Section 6: Household
- "I would like to take some small thing... It would make me feel that I have power" (80-81).
- "They only show us victories, never defeats. Who wants bad news?" (83).
- "Which of us is it worse for, her or me?" (95)


## Section 7: Night
- "...nobody dies from lack of sex. It's lack of love we die from" (103).
- "I believe in the resistance as I believe there can be no light without shadow; or rather, no shadow unless there is also light" (105).


## Section 8: Birth Day
This section is about a "Birth Day", in the sense that it's a day when a child is being born (Ofwarren aka Janine is having a child).

- "I dress, not looking down" (110).
- "What will Ofwarren give birth to? ... There's no telling. They could tell once, with machines, but that is now outlawed. What would be the point of knowing, anyway? You can't have them taken out; whatever it is must be carried to term" (112).
	- Even in a world so obsessed with conceiving a child, there are no abortions allowed.
- "Some of [the Handmaids], why, they aren't even clean. And won't give you a smile, mope in their rooms, don't wash their hair, the _smell_. I have to get the Marthas to do it, almost have to hold her down in the bathtub..." (115).
	- It seems that the Handmaids' main purpose is conceiving children, and the cleaning or picking up groceries is secondary. Even if they don't perform these secondary duties, they're still kept around.
- "...they massage her tiny belly, just as if she's really about to give birth herself" (116).
- "The Commander, of course, is nowhere in sight... Probably he's figuring out when his promotion is likely to be announced, if all goes well. He's sure to get one, now" (116).
- "She expected me to vindicate her life for her, and the choices she'd made. I didn't want to live my life on her terms. I didn't want to be the model offspring, the incarnation of her ideas. We used to fight about that. I am not your justification for existence, I said to her once" (122).
- "Nevertheless we are jubilant, it's a victory, for all of us. We've done it" (127).
- "After that she'll be transferred, to see if she can do it again, with someone else who needs a turn. But she'll never be sent to the Colonies, she'll never be declared Unwoman. That is her reward" (127).
- "Moira was out there somewhere... Moira had power now, she'd been set loose, she'd set herself loose. She was now a loose woman... Moira was our fantasy" (133).
- "Maybe none of this is about control. Maybe it isn't really about who can own whom, who can do what to whom and get away with it, even as far as death. Maybe it isn't about who can sit and who has to kneel or stand or lie down, legs spread open. Maybe it's about who can do what to whom and be forgiven for it. Never tell me it amounts to the same thing" (135).


## Section 9: Night
- "[Men] only want one thing. You must learn to manipulate them, for your own good" (144).


## Section 10: Soul Scrolls
- "So there it was, out in the open: his wife didn't understand him. That's what I was there for, then. The same old thing. It was too banal to be true" (158).
- "Also: I now had power over [the Commander's wife], of a kind, although she didn't know it. And I enjoyed that. Why pretend? I enjoyed it a lot" (162).
- "To him I'm no longer merely a usable body. To him I'm not just a boat with no cargo... To him I am not merely empty" (163).
- "Ordering prayers from Soul Scrolls is supposed to be a sign of piety and faithfulness to the regime, so of course the Commanders' Wives do it a lot. It helps their husbands' careers" (167).
- "What I feel is relief. It wasn't me" (170).
	- After watching the Eyes kidnap a man off the street.
- "It was after the catastrophe, when they shot the president and machine-gunned the Congress and the army declared a state of emergency. They blamed it on the Islamic fanatics, at the time" (174).
- "There was a lot more music on the radio than usual, and fewer words" (175).
- "The army was there [when I got fired], and everything. Then I remembered something I'd seen and hadn't noticed, at the time. It wasn't the army. It was some other army" (179).
- "[Luke] doesn't mind this, I thought. He doesn't mind it at all. Maybe he even likes it. We are not each other's, anymore. Instead, I am his" (182).
	- Thought to Luke: "I couldn't afford to lose you" (182).
- To the Commander: "You want my life to be bearable to me" (187).


## Section 11: Night

- "That is what you have to do before you kill, I thought. You have to create an it, where none was before. You do that first, in your head, and then you make it real" (193).
- "It's my fault. I am forgetting too much" (193).
