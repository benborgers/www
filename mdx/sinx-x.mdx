<Equation string="\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} = 1" />

This is a unit circle, so there two radii are labeled with length <Equation inline string="1" />. The vertical line labeled <Equation inline string="\sin{x}" /> because sine of the angle <Equation inline string="x" /> is that line over the hypotenuse (<Equation inline string="1" />). The second vertical line is labeled <Equation inline string="\tan{x}" /> because tangent of the angle <Equation inline string="x" /> is that line over the base of the triangle (<Equation inline string="1" />).

Compare the areas of three regions on the diagram above:

- Blue: <Equation inline string="\frac{1}{2}(\text{base})(\text{height}) = \frac{1}{2}(1)(\sin{x}) = \frac{1}{2}\sin{x}" />
- Blue + yellow: <Equation inline string="\frac{x}{2\pi}(\pi) = \frac{x\pi}{2\pi} = \frac{x}{2}" />
    - The area of that sector of the circle is that part of the circle ($x$ radians out of $2\pi$ total radians around the circle) times the area of the circle (<Equation inline string="\pi r^2" />, or <Equation inline string="\pi 1^2" />, so <Equation inline string="\pi" />).
- Blue + yellow + red: <Equation inline string="\frac{1}{2}(\text{base})(\text{height}) = \frac{1}{2}(1)(\tan{x}) = \frac{1}{2}\tan{x}" />

We can see visually that these areas can be arranged in order of size like this:

- <Equation inline string="\frac{1}{2} \sin{x} < \frac{x}{2} < \frac{1}{2} \tan{x}" />
- <Equation inline string="\sin{x} < x < \tan{x}" />
- <Equation inline string="\frac{\sin{x}}{\sin{x}} < \frac{x}{\sin{x}} < \frac{\tan{x}}{\sin{x}}" />
    - Divide each term by <Equation inline string="\sin{x}" />
- <Equation inline string="1 < \frac{x}{\sin{x}} < \frac{1}{\cos{x}}" />
    - Simplify the last step
- <Equation inline string="1 > \frac{\sin{x}}{x} > \cos{x}" />
    - Take the reciprocal of each term, and therefore flip inequality signs

By the [Squeeze Theorem](/squeeze-theorem), we can see that <Equation inline string="\frac{\sin{x}}{x}" /> is "squeezed" between <Equation inline string="1" /> and <Equation inline string="\cos{x}" />. As <Equation inline string="x" /> tends to <Equation inline string="0" />, <Equation inline string="\cos{x}" /> tends to <Equation inline string="1" /> as well.

Therefore, <Equation inline string="\frac{\sin{x}}{x}" /> is squeezed between 1 and 1 as x → 0, so the limit of <Equation inline string="\frac{\sin{x}}{x}" /> is 1.
