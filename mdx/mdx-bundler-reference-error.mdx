title: "How to fix mdx-bundler ReferenceError: ReactDOM is not defined"

I kept getting this error when importing an external library into my MDX that I was bundling with `mdx-bundler`:

> ReferenceError: ReactDOM is not defined

Finally I tracked down that I could solve it at the spot where I call `mdx-bundler`'s `getMDXComponent` function:

```js
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

const Component = useMemo(() => getMDXComponent(code, { ReactDOM }), [code])
```

Passing in `ReactDOM` explicitly into `getMDXComponent` solved the issue.
