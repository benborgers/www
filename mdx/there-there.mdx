### Dene Oxendine

- Dene's uncle Lucas thinks about movies that he's going to make a lot.
- Lucas has started a project, recording the stories of American Indians in Oakland.
    - He asks them to tell him a story of how they ended up in Oakland, or what it's been like living in Oakland.
    - He then leaves the room to get out of the way, so it's almost like they're telling the story to themselves or to anyone and everyone behind the lens.
- Lucas has been drinking all his life, and is dying from damage to his liver.
    - When his mother (Norma) walks into the house with a look on her face that says that Lucas is dead, Dene runs to the park with Dene's camera.

- Edwin has spent the last four years unemployed, sitting at home all day staring at the internet.
- He's now 100 pounds heavier.

- Tony's control over his life has decreased.
    - "...wondering how he had wound up here under the moon ... hiding bullets in bushes" (143).

    - Fina was cursed by her father when she was eighteen, and had similar symptoms.

    - Octavio's mother didn't bother fixing the bullet holes in the walls, only replacing the windows and doors.
- After his father died, Sixto started coming around more.
    - He'd turn on the TV, smoke a blunt, and drink.

    - Octavio and Manny drove him to where the ambulances come in, and left him there.
    - They found out a week later that he wasn't dead when he showed up. Sylvia threw a trash bag full of his clothes at him and then Manny closed the door on him.

    - Daniel leaves $3,000 money on the kitchen counter in a white envelope, like Manny used to do.

- Thomas joins a drum group that meets on Tuesday nights, where he's also made to sing.
    - Bobby, a large Native man, leads the group.
- Thomas figured out that if he drank the right amount, the next day he'd find himself in (what he calls) *the State*.

## IV: Powwow

### Orvil Red Feather

- Orvil goes out on the field, with many other Indian dancers.
- He leaves his younger brothers in the stands.
- Orvil feels like a fraud, but then tries to force himself to shake off that feeling because if you feel like a fraud you'll end up acting like one.
- Later, Orvil will have to perform in front of judges. But for now, this is just the Grand Entry.

### Tony Loneman

    - Everyone's always stared at him, because of the Drome.
- A woman asks him for directions first, but actually wants to ask him about being Native American.
    - Tony has little patience for this, and thinks that all she wants is a token story to bring home about how she met a real, live Native American today.

### Blue

- She smokes, but feels guilty about, so she tries to say a little prayer every time she smokes.

    - Maybe her mother made it up.
    - Maybe she'll have to make up a name and tribe to pass on to her children.

    - They walked around a lake in awkward silence.
    - Blue sees Edwin as a co-worker and possible future friend, nothing more. Edwin might not have been on the same page? It isn't clear.
- When Blue arrives at Edwin's house to carpool to the powwow, he doesn't answer for a while, leaving her waiting outside his house.

### Dene Oxendene

- Dene's recording stories at the powwow, still using his uncle's camera.

- Dene enjoys the "unflinching stare into the void of addiction and depravity", and thinks his uncle would have too.
- Dene's still letting the content direct the vision, so he doesn't really know what the final production will look like.

### Opal Viola Victoria Bear Shield

- Turns out Opal is also at the powwow, even though the three grandsons didn't tell her they were going and don't know she's there.
- Opal hasn't heard a big drum like the one at the powwow since she was young.
    - This shows a kind of disconnection from her Native past.

### Edwin Black

- This chapter picks up where Blue's ended, with Edwin giving Blue a cup of coffee and them driving to the powwow.
- Edwin tells Blue about a story that he's been writing, about a native guy whose apartment gets taken over by another guy and his startup.
- Instead of leaving a safe full of money (actually visa gift cards, but close enough to cash, which is what they advertised) in the car, they bring it out so that it'll be easier to hand out prize money later.

### Calvin Johnson

- Calvin, Charles, Carlos, and Octavio are eating at a Denny's before they plan to rob the powwow.

- In the end, they're good with each other and shake hands.

- Harvey offers Jacquie to sleep in the other bed in his hotel room, but Jacquie refuses.
    - She says with men like Harvey, you can't always get the pig all the way out.

    - Blue goes white, and Edwin and Blue go back to their seats quickly.
    - Blue was freaked out because she thinks that Jacquie is her mom.

### Thomas Frank

- Thomas feels completed while sitting with Bobby and the others in front of his drum, like he's right where he's supposed to be right now.

### Loother and Lony

- Lony wants to get closer to the drums, to see what they're like.
    - He hadn't had any interest in this powwow stuff until this moment.
- As they walk closer, Loother keeps pulling Lony's shirt to get him on track towards getting lemonade.
- They hear what they think is the sound of people screaming.

### Daniel Gonzales

    - He tells her to wait, and that he'll be up pretty soon.

### Blue

- Edwin has been shot once in the stomach.
- As they arrive at the hospital, Opal's car also pulls up and Orvil is taken into the hospital.

### Opal Viola Victoria Bear Shield

- Opal's in the waiting room with everybody else, and starts to pray and silently beg for Orvil to make it.
- A doctor comes out, just one doctor, which Opal thinks might be better because doctors probably report death in pairs for moral support.
    - The doctor is saying something, but Opal can't listen to him yet. Instead, she's counting swings of the double doors.
    - Then, she looks up to see what the doctor has to say.

### Tony Loneman
