title: How to get Code Spell Check working in MDX files

By default, the [Code Spell Check](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) extension in VS Code doesn't apply to `.mdx` files.

You can change this by going to your installed extensions, opening Code Spell Checker, clicking on the gear icon, and then Extension Settings.

Scroll down to Enabled Language Ids, and click Add Item at the bottom of the list. Type in "mdx", and now it'll apply to any file that ends in `.mdx`!
