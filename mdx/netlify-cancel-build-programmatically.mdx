title: How to programmatically cancel a Netlify build

Sometimes you've got a build script for a Netlify site, and want to cancel the build and deploy if a certain condition is true a version of the website with an error doesn't get published.

To cancel the build in a Node.js script, just run:

```jsx
process.exit(1)
```

This causes the build to fail, and will show a message like this in your Netlify build logs:

<Image src="/images/netlify-build-cancelled.png" width={1244} height={442} />

If you want to add additional information on why the build failed, log a message before calling `process.exit`:

```jsx
console.warn('This is what went wrong.')
process.exit(1)
```
