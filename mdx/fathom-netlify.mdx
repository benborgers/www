title: How to use Fathom Analytics with Netlify

[Fathom](https://usefathom.com/ref/TUIPJE) (that's a referral link that gets you $10 credit) offers simple and privacy-focused analytics that you can use for your site when it's deployed on Netlify.

First, copy the HTML embed code right after creating the site in the Fathom dashboard. If you've lost that page, you can find the embed code again by going to Fathom's settings, **Sites**, and then clicking on the **Site ID**.

Now in the Netlify dashboard, open up the site you want to add analytics to. Go to **Site settings**, then **Build & deploy** in the sidebar and scroll down to **Snippet injection**. Add a snippet, set it to inject right before the closing `</head>` tag, name it something like "Fathom". Paste in your copied embed code from Fathom and save.

Now, future deploys of your Netlify site will have this Fathom tracking code injected in the HTML `<head>` on every page! This will only happen when it's deployed to Netlify and not when you're working locally, which is good because it prevents you from tracking yourself as a visitor while you're working on your website.
