title: "How to fix mdx-bundler “Unexpected <” error"

I was trying to import a component from another file into an MDX file that I was bundling using `mdx-bundler`, but it kept giving me this error message:

> Unexpected “&gt;”

I eventually tracked down that `esbuild` (which is used internally my `mdx-bundler`) expects React components to have the `.jsx` file extension, not `.js`. Changing the component's filename to end with `.jsx` solved the problem.
