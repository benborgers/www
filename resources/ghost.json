Almost nothing can compete. \n\nSo maybe, when I pick up a side project to work on by myself, Laravel will be my\nnew choice. For the sake of my brain, I need a good answer to this hypothetical\nquestion. \n\nWhat’s this blog for? \nI like the idea of having a whole catalog of thoughts and writing that people\ncan read back through, if they want. I always enjoy stumbling on internet rabbit\nholes where someone has been writing prolifically on their own website, and I\ncan just browse through a personal library and feel like I’m getting to know\nthem. \n\nSo I want to do that for myself. It’s cool that other people can read this, but\nalso it’s cool just to look back and browse at what I was thinking about. \n\nAlso, I’d just like to write more. Even if it’s not particularly good, I think\nwriting things down forces you to clarify your thoughts and put some weight\nbehind things that would otherwise just be passing thoughts. Recognizing what\nthings are going on inside my brain that I normally wouldn’t notice has been a\ncool side effect of writing these morning pages.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","author_id":"1","created_at":"2022-01-12T23:34:05.000Z","updated_at":"2022-01-13T20:45:52.000Z","published_at":"2022-01-13T20:45:23.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"62086f38ffb0f606165b82cb","uuid":"3bcfabe8-fc0e-4a3c-9389-2082eed04875","title":"Friday, January 14, 2022","slug":"2022-01-14","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"callout\",{\"calloutEmoji\":\"👋\",\"calloutText\":\"I’m trying the idea of <em>morning pages</em>, where I write three pages in the morning of whatever’s on my mind.

We drove back from the\ncabin in New Hampshire this morning, and I’m only sitting down to write this\nnow. But! Forming habits takes repeated following of the habit, so here I am\nanyway. Also, it’s fun. \n\nI moved opensheet to Cloudflare Workers\nAs an update to yesterday’s post, I successfully moved opensheet\n[https://github.com/benborgers/opensheet]’s servers to Cloudflare Workers\nyesterday! I’m seeing ~160,000 requests in the past 24 hours, so it’s humming\nalong nicely. \n\nI did a dumb thing where I didn’t make the new version accessible to other\nwebsites (usually someone is fetching opensheet’s data from their own website,\nand web browsers by default block this cross-website communication unless the\nreceiving website allows it explicitly), so I woke up this morning to a handful\nof emails from people nicely asking what happened. I fixed it\n[https://github.com/benborgers/opensheet/commit/6e62e5361f69bc8763af989a491e11485efb0e96] \nquickly this morning, so hopefully we’ll have smooth sailing from here on out. \n\nContemplating when to go back to college\nI’ve been contemplating when to go back to Tufts after winter break — classes\nstart next Wednesday, but they’re online for the first three days (Wednesday,\nThursday, and Friday) because of Covid and Omicron. Then, after the weekend, we\nstart in-person. \n\nSo until the weekend after classes start I could stay home, where the showers\naren’t shared amongst a dorm floor and the dessert isn’t as accessible (easily\naccessible desserts are deadly). \n\nBut on the other hand, I think I’ll be able to focus on online classes more\neasily if I take them from my dorm room. Over break I’ve been sleeping in and\nrolling out of bed midday, and the switch to being back “on” for classes\nwouldn’t be marked by anything significant. For the sake of separation, I’m\ncontemplating going back on Tuesday night so I can be there for when classes\nstart.

I need to hit that sweet sweet three-page word count for this morning’s\n    post, and am desperate for something to write about. \n\nSo yeah, I rented a tiny office near Tufts last month. \n\nIt’s really a tiny room in a construction park, about a half-hour walk away from\nTufts. \n\nI’ve wanted my own office since middle school, so I’m telling myself that this\nis an experiment to see whether I actually want one. It’s not exceedingly\nexpensive, and it gives me a dedicated place where I only do work. \n\nThe only barrier is whether I’ll actually go there — a half-hour walk both ways\nis a bit hefty. But I’d like to rebrand it to exercise instead, and now my\nproblems are all gone. \n\nPlus, I think the walk might serve as a bit of a centering exercise — if I’m\ntaking the time to walk here, I might as well actually get done what I wanted to\nget done and then leave sooner rather than later. \n\nOf course, this is all purely hypothetical. It’s quite cold right now in the\nBoston area, so whether I’m so excited about the half-hour commute remains to be\nseen. \n\nBut ideally, I’d like the office to be the place where I go in the mornings on\nMondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. On Mondays and Wednesdays, I don’t have class\nuntil 3pm. On Fridays, I don’t have classes at all. \n\nThere’s a real risk of those mornings just slipping away into nothingness as the\nsemester goes on, but if I can drag myself to an office early in the morning, I\nthink I’ll be able to crank out a solid couple hours of work before returning to\ncampus for a late lunch. \n\nThe other tool for keeping me on track? You, dear reader. I can’t embarrass\nmyself in front of the audience. Whether you’re there or not, there’s\naccountability. Speaking of which:\n\nPresenting... today’s to-do’s! \n * [x] Do some freelance work for Buttondown [https://buttondown.email].\n   Ideally, I’d like to get my current project in a presentable state. \n * [x] Read the article I have to read for Intro to World Music. Getting my\n   first homework assignment this morning in my email inbox hit me like a truck. \n * [ ] Read 3 more chapters of The Anthropocene Reviewed.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","author_id":"1","created_at":"2022-01-17T02:17:01.000Z","updated_at":"2022-01-17T21:44:27.000Z","published_at":"2022-01-17T14:39:24.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"62086f38ffb0f606165b82d0","uuid":"2926439b-433d-4cf1-8f5a-6670723a5aed","title":"An emoji picker epiphany","slug":"war-room-reacts","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/01/image-2.png\",\"width\":1266,\"height\":1554}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/01/image-4.png\",\"width\":1330,\"height\":488}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/01/image-5.png\",\"width\":1318,\"height\":404}]],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"__GHOST_URL__/war-room\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://emojicdn.elk.sh\"]],[\"strong\"],[\"em\"]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"I created this app called \"],[0,[0],1,\"War Room\"],[0,[],0,\" where my friends and I can see each other’s to-do lists, and completed tasks go on a public feed for all your friends to see.

It’s mostly for me, but I’m publishing them too\nbecause why not.Good morning! Ian wrote a very nice blog post\n[https://tunnington.com/ben-made-this-for-me/] yesterday about the blog I set up\nfor him. Thanks Ian! I’m very much enjoying reading your writing. \n\nI can’t imagine what I felt like before\nI get headaches fairly frequently. My dad also got them when he was young, and\neventually they went away. Here’s to hoping that headache-frequency is\nhereditary. \n\nBut when I have a headache, I often observe a thought: \n\n> In this moment, I can’t remember what it feels like not to have a headache. \nI’m thinking of packing up my stuff and heading back to college today. But in\nthe same way, I can’t remember what it feels like to be stressed about classes.\nOf course I remember last semester, but I can’t really get myself feel the\nstress that I know I felt at times. \n\nNothing to worry about though. I’m sure I’ll be reminded of what it feels like\nto be stressed about classes in due time. \n\nMy brain wants to close the loop\nI’ve noticed this phenomenon in my brain more and more recently:\n\nOnce I’ve started something, my brain desperately wants to close the loop and\nfinish it as soon as possible. \n\nI don’t like leaving things half-finished. I can feel it itching in the back of\nmy brain, wishing I could just lay it to bed. \n\nLet me give an example: \n\nA couple mornings ago [__GHOST_URL__/2022-01-13/#all-hands-on-deck-this-morning]\n, I had to move the servers of a project for a client from one set of servers to\nanother. I re-wrote some of the code, migrated it, and sent the client the new\nlinks for the servers so he could have his team update the links they were\nusing. \n\nHe said he’d text me when everything was moved, so I could delete the old\nservers. And he’d let me know if there were any problems. \n\nBut I just wanted to be done. For my brain, the loop was still open: there could \nbe problems with this new version, and I also still have to delete the old\nservers, so I can’t just lay it to rest in my brain right now. \n\nI think this feeling might be a defense mechanism: I whole-heartedly believe\nthat my memory is worse than the average human’s. (I started using Todoist in\nsixth grade, and Evernote around the same time as well. Can you imagine a\n12-year-old walking around with a task manager and note-taking app? Maybe if you\nknow me, this comes as no surprise to you. But I wouldn’t be surprised if my\nattraction to to-do lists, notes, and calendars sprung out of a feeling that I\ncouldn’t reliably retain all of it in my brain. Or maybe my inability to retain\nthings in my brain comes from rendering it unnecessary since middle school by\nusing tools? Let’s not contemplate this right now.)\n\nThe point is, if I start something and get halfway without closing the loop,\nthere’s a real worry that I’ll have trouble recalling all of the context at a\nlater point. \n\nUsually, I fight the uneasiness by adding things to my to-do list, or making a\nseparate checklist. And as a result, stuff gets overlooked less often. Maybe\nthat uneasy feeling when a loop isn’t closed is my brain warning me that I\nbetter offload the memory of this half-finished task to somewhere else,\notherwise bad things will come my way. \n\nHere’s another example from yesterday: \n\nIn May, I signed up for a Google Workspace (Google’s suite for businesses), and\ngot myself the spiffy email address ben@elk.sh. I wanted features that Google\nwas only offering to businesses in Google Drive. \n\nBut it left me with my stuff spread across two Google accounts: my old personal\naccount, and this new Google Workspace account (where I was the Google Workspace\nadministrator and the only account). \n\nYesterday, on a complete whim, I decided that I wanted to get rid of that Google\nWorkspace account and switch my email back to HEY [https://hey.com], which I\ncancelled in May. (You might see from this that I’m quite indecisive—that might\nmake for good morning pages writing material sometime.)\n\nOnce I got this idea in my head, my brain needed to finish on that same day. I\ncouldn’t leave the loop unclosed, and I succeeded — by the end of the day, I had\nexported 25 GB worth of content from ben@elk.sh, moved over my calendar, email,\nand Google Drive, and forwarded everything to my new (old) email address, \nbenborgers@hey.com. \n\nI really just wanted to be done with the whole migration by the end of the day.\nNo loose ends, everything tidy and clean. \n\nAnd of course, I didn’t trust my brain to hold on to all of the small tasks that\nwere flying into my brain.

I have this vindictive urge to be\nextremely well-prepared for this class: You think you can embarrass us in front\nof the class? I’ll show you!\n\nBut I doubt that this professor’s lectures will do very much in the way of\nlearning vocabulary and grammar. Instead, this semester can be a test of my raw\nmemorization abilities, using that spaced repetition app. Kind of an interesting\nchallenge. \n\nMorning routines take too long\nI hate morning routines. \n\nI feel like they take too long. It’s the thing that I need to get through in\norder to get on with my morning; to do real things. \n\nI find myself frustrated with how long they take, and just wishing I could fast\nforward this part. This feeling is usually coupled with me getting up later than\nI’d like, so I’m already on edge about wasting half of the day.\n\nI don’t really know what the solution is here — perhaps I could offload more of\nmy morning routine to the evening? \n\nI’ve always been a morning shower person, but perhaps flipping the habit would\ngive me less things to push through in the morning.\n\nI also shave in the morning, really a 150-second task that still feels far too\nlong when I’m already feeling like the morning is getting off to a late start. \n\nSometimes I just wish that someone else could drive my body through my morning\nroutine and return it to me in 30 minutes. When someone figures out how to do\nthis, I’ll be first in line. \n\nJust Like the Sea\nI’m listening to music as I write this. I shuffled my Liked Songs playlist, and\nthe song that came up as I was thinking of what to write next was Just Like the\nSea, a relatively obscure song by the PigPen Theater Co. \n\nIt’s in my liked songs because they played it in the theater as the audience was\nfiltering in before performances of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, the last play\nI was ever in at Magic Circle, a theater camp I went to over summers from 5th to\n9th grade. \n\nThe song violently rips me back into that time — how much I loved that camp, and\nhow much I tried but failed to realize how special my time there was until it\nwas long in the past. \n\nBut the meaning assigned to this song is retroactive — I only have vague\nmemories of hearing it played as we scrambled to get ready backstage and peeked\nout through cracks to see how many people had come to this performance. \n\nI mostly know of the song because fellow campers who ran tech for the show told\nme about it, and since then I’ve listened to it and poured my feelings for this\nsummer camp into it. \n\nIt’s not really an authentic memory, but instead a vessel for all the memories\nI’ve poured into it over the past few years — perhaps that’s all that matters. \n\nThe cast of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, summer 2018.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","author_id":"1","created_at":"2022-01-20T23:03:40.000Z","updated_at":"2022-01-21T16:33:54.000Z","published_at":"2022-01-21T16:27:19.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"62086f38ffb0f606165b82d5","uuid":"6065483b-a7a6-4167-b1b7-bda7d4316921","title":"i’m scared of being a one-sided person","slug":"im-scared-of-being-a-one-sided-person","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"ghostVersion\":\"4.0\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"\"]]]]}","html":null,"comment_id":"61eb65ed57cf80197d835f80","plaintext":null,"feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"draft","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","author_id":"1","created_at":"2022-01-22T02:03:25.000Z","updated_at":"2022-01-22T02:03:25.000Z","published_at":null,"custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"62086f38ffb0f606165b82d6","uuid":"51360e18-3fcc-469d-b33b-b39004a78e8d","title":"what if you broke the standard methods of engagement in frisbee","slug":"are-we-all-playing-along","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"ghostVersion\":\"4.0\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"\"]]]]}","html":null,"comment_id":"61eb786757cf80197d835f84","plaintext":null,"feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"draft","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","author_id":"1","created_at":"2022-01-22T03:22:15.000Z","updated_at":"2022-01-22T03:22:30.000Z","published_at":null,"custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"62086f38ffb0f606165b82d7","uuid":"6df70c23-2472-4834-92a0-fe7ac9712b8e","title":"being a steward of Blocks","slug":"blocks-stewardship","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"ghostVersion\":\"4.0\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"\"]]]]}","html":null,"comment_id":"61eb78b057cf80197d835f8a","plaintext":null,"feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"draft","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","author_id":"1","created_at":"2022-01-22T03:23:28.000Z","updated_at":"2022-01-22T03:23:59.000Z","published_at":null,"custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"62086f38ffb0f606165b82d8","uuid":"8faf9c0d-2f48-4de4-a1da-1ff0da000f19","title":"Why Do We Still Use Snapchat?","slug":"snapchat","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[[\"em\"]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Every morning I fire up Snapchat and reply to a built-up pile of everybody’s snaps from the past 24 hours or so. \"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"It’s a completely meaningless activity: I open up a couple dozen photos of people’s faces, which I cannot see again after this one time so I better savor it while it lasts.

Is this who I want to be?\n\nNot only is it not “nice,” it also probably does some kind of tangible harm.\nSubjects like Computer Science have a hard enough time seeming approachable,\nespecially to groups of people traditionally not included in such disciplines. \n\nAt best these sorts of answers make them think twice before posting another\nquestion later, and at worst they completely sour their early interactions with\nComputer Science. \n\nIt’s hard to remember in that moment to be kind. It feels overly kind, even. But\nI’m writing this mostly as a reminder to myself: being passive aggressive in\nthat moment is probably not worth it. Even if I’m not in the most helpful mood,\neven if they’re asking something that’s been asked before. It won’t take more\nenergy to be kind than to be a passive aggressive. So don’t be a jerk.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","author_id":"1","created_at":"2022-01-29T04:31:54.000Z","updated_at":"2022-02-28T18:47:45.000Z","published_at":"2022-01-29T18:49:38.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"62086f38ffb0f606165b82f4","uuid":"f9a6e073-156e-4f9f-aa7b-69321fa038f1","title":"Being

When I’m trying to remember how to write\na Chinese character, I can tell whether my brain is conjuring it up from the\n“front” of my mind, or whether it needs to dig it out from the depths of my\nmemory, sometimes part by part. And it feels more satisfying when I’m able to\ndig it up from the depths! It feels like reassurance that the long-term storage\nof information is working for these Chinese characters. \n\nThis isn’t particularly groundbreaking by any means — I’m sure you’ve\nexperienced the same feeling as well — but it was interesting to realize that I\ncan do that. That somehow, my brain can observe how well my brain is recalling\nsomething. \n\nSometimes I can even imagine the shape of the character I’m trying to write, but\nnot every part of it. I don’t even quite know how to describe the shape — I can\njust feel it. And I’m able to observe that I only remember the shape, and make\nmeta-commentary on that to myself. \n\nThis sort of metacognition is wild to think about. When I’m observing my ability\nto recall something, and sensing whether it’s from short or long-term memory, it\nfeels like I’m observing an outside thing. I might as well be observing someone\nelse, except that I have deep insight into how their brain feels from the\ninside. \n\nBut I’m not observing someone else. My brain is observing itself. And that by\nitself is an extremely interesting feat that humans can do.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","author_id":"1","created_at":"2022-01-31T16:25:03.000Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T18:08:48.000Z","published_at":"2022-02-03T18:08:48.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"62086f38ffb0f606165b8300","uuid":"da58788d-1482-434c-b343-2e40396cb9fc","title":"Good Software Has a Clear Geography","slug":"breadcrumbs","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/02/image-2.png\",\"width\":1594,\"height\":272,\"caption\":\"“Breadcrumbs” show the navigational hierarchy.\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/02/image-1.png\",\"width\":1598,\"height\":1260,\"caption\":\"Seeing the last page under the current page.\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/02/image-3.png\",\"width\":2268,\"height\":892,\"caption\":\"I stole this idea from Basecamp.\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/02/image.png\",\"width\":1598,\"height\":1190,\"caption\":\"Clicking the “How do students join?” link opens a “modal” that overlays the rest of the interface.\"}]],\"markups\":[[\"strong\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://basecamp.com\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"I think that one of the most important things when building good software is that \"],[0,[0],1,\"the user always knows where they are, relative to the app’s geography\"],[0,[],0,\". \"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"For me, not knowing where I am in an app’s navigational structure is disorienting and overwhelming.

Here’s how\nthat came to be. \n\nIn the year above me at Lexington High School we had Samuel Jefferson Andrews,\nwho had amassed 2 million TikTok followers\n[https://www.tiktok.com/@samueljeffersonandrews]. My understanding is that,\nduring my junior year, the Chick-fil-A in Waltham ran a competition on Instagram\nwhere you could win free Chick-fil-A sandwiches for your entire school. You\ncommented your school’s name, and if you got your classmates to give you the\nmost likes, your school would win. \n\nSamuel Jefferson Andrews turned his TikTok audience towards his comment, and won\nthe competition for us. But when the cards were delivered a couple months later,\nCovid had closed down school. Several thousand gift cards sat inside the school\nover the summer. \n\nThen, in the fall of my senior year, the school’s social worker gave the gift\ncards to the former junior class president. I think it was some vague plot to\nhave someone distribute them; at the very least, the social worker got the\nresponsibility of distributing them off of her hands. \n\nBut not much happened, except that my friends and I got in touch with the junior\nclass president and treated ourselves to many free Chick-fil-A sandwiches. \n\nThen, around Thanksgiving, I realized that I could use Blocks to distribute the\ncards! I messaged her and asked if I could take 400 cards off her hands, and\npurchased hundreds of envelopes to package them:\n\n0:00/1×I then built a wheel that you could spin in order to win two Chick-fil-A\ngift cards (I packaged 200 packs of two cards each), and put it in a secondary\ntab of the app. You could spin once per hour. \n\nScreenshots from Trisha, who was the first winner and won two times.

But it seems like something Facebook\nwould do. Oops. \n\nA “Random” Algorithm for Picking Winners\nSince the giveaway is in the distant past, I can publicly reveal the algorithm\nfor selecting winners for the first time ever. \n\nPrimary source records from the blocks-v2 codebase.How this code works:\n\n * First, we check if the user is allowed to spin (whether they’ve used up their\n   spin for this hour). \n * Then, we find what the latest winning spin by anyone was. \n * We calculate a “cooldown period” (in minutes). The cooldown period is, on\n   average, less for upperclassmen. This is because I’m a bad person and wanted\n   to favor upperclassmen, being a senior myself. \n * The user wins if it’s been more than {cooldown} minutes since the last win.\n   If they win, we generate a random place within the red (“winning”) slice of\n   the spinner (-9º to 9º) to stop the spinner at. \n * Otherwise, they’ve lost. We stop the spinner anywhere between 11º and 349º. \n\nYou’ll notice that this is a random algorithm, but not random in the way that\nyou’d assume. There are no set odds of winning per spin. \n\nInstead, this algorithm produces a win every 20-45 minutes, and once one winner\nhas been chosen, no one else can win for at least 20 minutes. \n\nI did it this way because I wasn’t sure how many people would play, so I didn’t\nknow how to set the probabilities. So instead, it seemed reasonable to limit the \npace of winners to 1-2 per hour. \n\nA side effect of this method is that you have much better chances of winning if\nyou play while everybody else is asleep and not playing. But people didn’t know\nhow the algorithm worked, so they didn’t know that. \n\nMaking the Deliveries\nYou see how the app asked for people’s addresses? That’s not because I shipped\nthem their prizes. I decided to be frugal, and hand-delivered the envelopes to\nevery winner in Lexington. \n\nFor that week, I made 200 deliveries to separate houses.

And usually, it comes in the form of an email. \n\nFor Tufts Residential Life, this information is a description of how the housing\nselection process for next year works. I’d gotten a lottery number a month ago,\nand had a vague idea of how suites and rooms work for sophomores, but I didn’t\nreally understand the process. \n\nThen, I got an email from Residential Life telling us about four live Zoom\nwebinars they were running in order to explain the process and answer questions. \n\nI went to one, and when the hour was up, my roommate came back. He asked if\nthere was anything he should know from the webinar, and explaining it to him\ntook a minute or two. \n\nReally? Information that could’ve been boiled down to a couple minutes took an\nhour to disseminate live. Someone had to sit there and click through a\npresentation for an hour to get this to me. \n\nThere’s got to be more efficient ways of distributing information to a large\npopulation. \n\nAs an experiment, let me try to explain to you everything you need to know about\nTufts’ housing process: \n\n> There’s a couple days at the end of March where you form your group. Each day is\nfor forming a different-sized group: the first is ten-person groups, then\nsingles, etc. At the end of each day, they tell you based on your lottery number\nwhether your group will work. So if there’s 40 ten-person suites available and\n45 groups try to form, the 5 groups with the worst lottery numbers will be told\nto try a different configuration in the coming days. The dates for group\nformation are on a website, I’m sure you can find them by searching. \n\nSo by the end of those days, you know what type of housing you’re getting, just\nnot which exact room. Then you’re given a date and time to select the exact room\nor suite that you want, and your “group leader” picks that at the designated\ntime. \nIt really isn’t that much information. And I’m sure I could’ve condensed this\nbetter, but I’m lazy and not willing to put that much effort into this thought\nexperiment. \n\nSo why’d that take an hour? \n\nDon’t tell people more than they need\nThey spent a ton of time going over the exact dates for sophomores, juniors, and\nseniors. I have retained nothing except for that the dates for sophomores were\nMarch 20-something? \n\nSo don’t tell me these things. I’m not gonna retain the exact details. Instead,\ntell me how to find them. It’s all on the internet! \n\nAnd for the love of god please don’t put a URL on the slide. I can barely\nremember the names of my professors from last semester. I’m never gonna remember\nyour (ugly-looking) URL. \n\nInstead, just tell me to google it. I’ll probably be able to find it. Problem\nsolved. \n\nNot condensing information is inconsiderate\nI think that often these presentations come out of not wanting to boil down\ninformation so far that it even feels like it’s too little. You’re intentionally\nleaving things out!\n\nBut that’s okay. That’s what you have the website for. That’s why people can\ncontact you with questions. \n\nBy going in the information-stuffing direction, and throwing in every single\ndetail that you possibly can, you’re being inconsiderate. \n\nIf people come, you’re wasting a month of combined human time on this single\nwebinar, because you couldn’t condense the information such that it’d be\nreasonable. \n\nBut more likely, people just aren’t gonna show up. The housing webinar I\nattended, the first of four, had less than 30 people in attendance. Since\nthey’re forcing people to digest this information in a one-hour live session,\npeople just aren’t getting the information at all. And that’s counter-productive\nto what they’re trying to do (I hope?). \n\nWhat about the Q&A? \nPerhaps another argument for a live webinar is that people can ask questions\nthat they have. Which is fair! People always have questions about a complicated\nprocess like this. \n\nBut a good FAQ on a website will do just as well, and you can have people email\nif they have further questions. And if someone emails a question you forgot\nabout, you can add it to the FAQ!\n\nEven better, you’ll be able to have a library of questions and answers to carry\nfrom year to year. You don’t have to rely on someone asking every good question\nduring every webinar. \n\nNothing’s forcing it to be good\nThe reason why information distribution is usually bad is that there’s nothing\nforcing it to be good. Nothing bad really happens if you present housing\ninformation badly. There’s a bunch of confused people, but they’ll figure it out\neventually. Or they won’t. Either way, Residential Life isn’t really impacted. \n\nSo in all likelihood, these kinds of things will continue to be mediocre. But\nit’s fun to dream about how they could be better, and complain from the outside\nwithout actually having to do the work of making it better.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","author_id":"1","created_at":"2022-02-21T16:53:59.000Z","updated_at":"2022-02-21T18:02:03.000Z","published_at":"2022-02-21T18:02:03.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"62164493ffb0f606165b885d","uuid":"1414716b-f8b8-4e88-97a5-cde6af1fdbdd","title":"How to log in to a Laravel Forge database with TablePlus","slug":"forge-tableplus","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"code\",{\"code\":\"cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\",\"language\":\"bash\"}],[\"code\",{\"code\":\"ssh-rsa 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 ben@Bens-MacBook-Pro.local\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/02/image-17.png\",\"width\":2486,\"height\":1024}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/02/image-19.png\",\"width\":1224,\"height\":1504,\"caption\":\"Where to paste the database password that Forge emailed you when your server was provisioned.&nbsp;\"}]],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://forge.laravel.com\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://tableplus.com/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent\"]],[\"em\"],[\"code\"],[\"strong\"]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"I recently started working with \"],[0,[0],1,\"Laravel Forge\"],[0,[],0,\", and wanted to connect to a production database from my local computer, using \"],[0,[1],1,\"TablePlus\"],[0,[],0,\". \"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"It took a bit to figure out where to put which passwords, so I thought I’d write a blog post about it. \"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"First, you’ll want to have your computer’s SSH keys uploaded to Forge, so your computer can log into the server that Forge created. \"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"If you haven’t generated SSH keys on your computer, you can \"],[0,[2],1,\"follow these instructions\"],[0,[],0,\". \"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Now, you’ll want to copy and paste your \"],[0,[3],1,\"public\"],[0,[],0,\" SSH key.

I enjoy\ntesting out new stuff too much; a shiny new app comes around, or I just want the\nfeatures back from an app I used to use, so I switch. \n\nAnd at the end of the day, it doesn’t really matter! I feel like it matters that\nmy notes are all located in the same app, but I’ve also never had an issue\nremembering which app I was using when I took those notes. It’s a problem that\nI’ve never actually had. For some reason, my memory for “where did I take these\nnotes” seems quite strong. \n\nSo at the end of the day, maybe my “identity” (for myself, in my own brain) is \njumping around from app to app when I feel like I want to. I’ll keep doing that.\nIt makes me happy.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","author_id":"1","created_at":"2022-03-02T00:04:28.000Z","updated_at":"2022-03-02T02:51:02.000Z","published_at":"2022-03-02T02:51:02.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"621ee7fbffb0f606165b8c5b","uuid":"6d3b9f1c-6008-4e0a-b3ea-8e114b2269f0","title":"Testing Makes Coding More Fun (For HW)","slug":"testing-makes-coding-more-fun-for-hw","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"ghostVersion\":\"4.0\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"\"]]]]}","html":null,"comment_id":"621ee7fbffb0f606165b8c5b","plaintext":null,"feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"draft","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","author_id":"1","created_at":"2022-03-02T03:43:55.000Z","updated_at":"2022-03-02T03:43:55.000Z","published_at":null,"custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"621f790e82cacf9d0a0e454a","uuid":"f9853a5c-931b-4072-b9c0-35a97dfd76a5","title":"How to make an arrow with pure Tailwind CSS","slug":"tailwind-arrow","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/03/image-7.png\",\"width\":66,\"height\":64}],[\"code\",{\"code\":\"<div class=\\\"h-0 w-0 border-x-8 border-x-transparent border-b-[16px] border-b-blue-600\\\"></div>\",\"language\":\"html\"}],[\"embed\",{\"url\":\"https://codepen.io/chriscoyier/pen/DELgOJ\",\"html\":\"<iframe id=\\\"cp_embed_lotjh\\\" src=\\\"https://codepen.io/chriscoyier/embed/preview/lotjh?default-tabs=css%2Cresult&amp;height=300&amp;host=https%3A%2F%2Fcodepen.io&amp;slug-hash=lotjh\\\" title=\\\"Animation to Explain CSS Triangles\\\" scrolling=\\\"no\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" allowtransparency=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"cp_embed_iframe\\\" style=\\\"width: 100%; overflow: hidden;\\\"></iframe>\",\"type\":\"rich\",\"metadata\":{\"success\":true,\"version\":\"1.0\",\"provider_name\":\"Codepen\",\"provider_url\":\"https://codepen.io\",\"title\":\"Animation to Explain CSS Triangles\",\"author_name\":\"Chris Coyier \",\"author_url\":\"https://codepen.io/chriscoyier\",\"height\":\"300\",\"width\":\"800\",\"thumbnail_width\":\"384\",\"thumbnail_height\":\"225\",\"thumbnail_url\":\"https://assets.codepen.io/3/internal/screenshots/pens/lotjh.custom.jpg?version=1547160157\"}}]],\"markups\":[[\"code\"],[\"em\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://play.tailwindcss.com/BNW4VNbP5K\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"You can create an arrow with pure Tailwind CSS by adding these CSS classes to a \"],[0,[0],1,\"div\"],[0,[],0,\": \"]]],[3,\"ul\",[[[0,[0],1,\"h-0\"],[0,[],0,\" and \"],[0,[0],1,\"w-0\"]],[[0,[0],1,\"border-x-8\"],[0,[],0,\" and \"],[0,[0],1,\"border-x-transparent\"]],[[0,[0],1,\"border-b-8\"],[0,[],0,\" and \"],[0,[0],1,\"border-b-blue-600\"]]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"This creates a small triangle in color \"],[0,[0],1,\"blue-600\"],[0,[],0,\" that looks like this:\"]]],[10,0],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"You can swap out the \"],[0,[0],1,\"blue-600\"],[0,[],0,\" for any other color to change the color of the triangle. \"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"To get a differently sized or proportioned arrow, you can tweak the widths of the borders, like this (note that the transparent border doesn’t need to be the same width as the colored one): \"]]],[10,1],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"To get an arrow that points left or right, you can use \"],[0,[0],1,\"border-y-8\"],[0,[],0,\" and \"],[0,[0],1,\"border-y-transparent\"],[0,[],0,\" instead.

XIII, two decades to get someone to\nfigure it out. \n\nThen in February of 1582, Pope Gregory signed the Gregorian calendar into use,\nwhich fixed these problems so well that we still use it today. \n\nPart of implementing the Gregorian calendar involved skipping 10 days in order\nto bring Easter back to where it should be. The church chose October so they\nwouldn’t skip any all-important festivals, and because of that October 4th of\n1582 was directly followed by October 15th. Kinda insane. \n\nAnd in fact, this caused more problems at the time: Protestant and Orthodox\ncountries refused to let the pope tell them what to do, so countries in Central\nEurope jumped ahead 10 days while the rest of Europe stayed 10 days in the past. \n\nTime is entirely a made-up concept. But the in 1582, scientists and\nmathematicians thought up a calendar that worked well enough that we still use\nit today — 10 day skips and all.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","author_id":"1","created_at":"2022-03-05T12:50:07.000Z","updated_at":"2022-03-06T04:07:48.000Z","published_at":"2022-03-06T04:07:48.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"6223b36682cacf9d0a0e467f","uuid":"1b7b9b28-bfb0-421e-8bd9-8081870dfa41","title":"How to fix “Deprecation Notice” when using Laravel CLI","slug":"laravel-deprecation-notice","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"code\",{\"code\":\"composer self-update\",\"language\":\"bash\"}],[\"code\",{\"code\":\"composer global update\",\"language\":\"bash\"}]],\"markups\":[[\"code\"]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"When I updated my computer’s version of PHP to version 8.1, I was getting some big “Deprecation Notice” errors in my console when I was running commands like \"],[0,[0],1,\"laravel new\"],[0,[],0,\" or when using the Laravel CLI in other ways. \"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"It seems like Laravel’s CLI previously used code features that are going to be deprecated, and PHP 8.1 has started warning about those soon-to-be-removed features. \"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"However, the code for Laravel’s CLI has been updated to get rid of these warnings!

But that’s an entirely unrealistic number of meal swipes\nto need, so I wanted to figure out what meal plan I was going to get next year. \n\nFirst of all, the pricing for the second-highest plan is predatory: it’s only\n$350 less than the Ultra Platinum Supreme Overkill plan, so it upsells people to\nthe most expensive plan (“eh, why not upgrade if it’s not much more expensive”).\nPlus, the third-highest plan’s 10 meals a week isn’t really enough (it’s not\nquite equivalent to skipping breakfast). \n\nBut it’s more than that: let’s figure out what you’re actually buying with each\nmeal plan: \n\n * For the 220 plan, you’re buying swipes for $15.16 each. \n * For the 160 plan, you’re buying swipes for $15.33 each. \n\nCompare that with the price that it would cost to pay JumboCash to swipe into a\ndining hall: (I actually called Tufts Dining Services Administration to ask for\nthese prices)\n\n * Breakfast: $8.97\n * Lunch: $14.95\n * Dinner: $16.95\n\nThat means that, for all meals except for dinner, you’re overpaying by using a\nmeal swipe rather than buying it outright using JumboCash (which you fill up at\na one-to-one conversion rate with a credit card). \n\nPlus, Tufts has good “fast casual” places with sandwiches/burritos/etc. Those\nplaces are usually better than the dining halls anyway. You can still use meal\nswipes there, but each swipe has a dollar-amount equivalency (and if you go over\nthat amount, you pay the rest using JumboCash). Here are the equivalencies: \n\n * Breakfast: $7.45\n * Lunch: $12.41\n * Dinner: $14.07\n\nThat means that at the fast casual establishments at Tufts, you cannot possibly \nget your money’s worth on a meal swipe. Even at dinner, you’re losing money —\nand that’s assuming that you use the meal swipe’s exact dollar equivalency and\nnothing more. \n\nSo unless my logic doesn’t make sense somewhere (please tell me if there’s a\nhole in this reasoning), it seems like the Tufts meal plans aren’t financially\nworth it at all. You’re better off paying for everything using real money. \n\nTufts might not let sophomores have no meal plan. But it seems to me that the\nmost financially savvy meal plan is the most minimal meal plan possible, and to\nthe pay the rest out-of-pocket.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","author_id":"1","created_at":"2022-03-09T16:27:51.000Z","updated_at":"2022-03-09T19:40:46.000Z","published_at":"2022-03-09T19:40:46.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"622a917182cacf9d0a0e49d1","uuid":"1aae5142-045c-4fee-87a7-ca8e62b172c9","title":"Heart Reacts","slug":"heart-reacts","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/03/image-1.png\",\"width\":696,\"height\":148,\"caption\":\"\"}]],\"markups\":[[\"em\"]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Heart reacts have got to be one of the best inventions in modern text-based communication. \"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"By that, I mean the ability on any platform (iMessage, Messenger, Instagram, Discord, and scores of others) to react to a message with a heart: \"]]],[10,0],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"I \"],[0,[0],1,\"love\"],[0,[],0,\" heart reacts.

The article raises an\ninteresting point that I think I agree with, but it also had some bits that made\nmy blood boil: \n\n> Life isn’t meant to be an endless parade of amusements.\n> If you complained about being bored [in the 70’s], you were really asking for\nit. “Go outside,” you might get, or worse, “Clean your room.” Was this fun? No.\nWas it helpful? Yes.\n> Teachers spend more time concocting ways to “engage” students through visuals\nand “interactive learning”...\nI think it’s this kids these days energy that I despise. An oozing of\nsuperiority. And despite the fact that she might be right, I still want her to\nshut up. \n\nIt’s the packaging of the idea, rather than the idea itself. When an idea is\npackaged in a way that feels demeaning and humiliating, the idea itself falls\nonto deaf ears. I’m fine with someone asking me to empty the dishwasher. I don’t\nwant to be told that kids these days are too absorbed in their devices to do\nchores. \n\nWhat’s more: I know that there’s truth to that! I’m aware of the toll on our\nattention that modern technology has taken, and that I’m as addicted to it as\nanyone else. But when someone else tells me that, I lock up and get defensive. \n\nIt’s true that there are “hard truths” that need to be delivered. But hard\ntruths can still be delivered with kindness. \n\nPlus, it’s not like the world is getting progressively worse and people from\npast generations are the only ones who can stop that. Remember how in the good\nol’ days before personal computing, it was acceptable to bully kids for their\nsexual orientation? Sit down. \n\nHere’s another example: in junior year of high school, they spent an abundance\nof time teaching us about transcendentalism. What I’ve retained is that\ntranscendentalists were people who thought everybody should go outside and enjoy\nnature instead of being so into your devices so much. \n\n👋As a sidenote, I just googled it and Transcendentalism is actually about the\nindividual having a direct connection to God.

I\ndon’t have a ton of followers (271 as of this writing), but it’s the most\nvaluable “audience” that I own. \n\nEssentially every programming work opportunity has come from people who follow\nme on Twitter because I post tidbits of my work. I am immensely grateful for\nthat and don’t want to lose that outlet. \n\nbenborgers.com is this website that you’re currently reading this blog post on.\n2½ years ago I started posting blog posts on programming topics, with the goal\nthat people would find them through Google search. I didn’t know what I’d do\nwith a website that got search traffic (and still do not), but I thought it’d be\ncool (and still do).\n\nThen in January of this year, I started writing personal blog posts on another\ndomain, and eventually migrated them here to benborgers.com. \n\nI’ve really enjoyed the consistency of writing every day. I hope that it makes\nme a better writer, and I know that it’s interesting to have a large pile of\nthoughts preserved. I don’t know whether daily blog posts will go on forever,\nbut for now I really enjoy it and am too stubborn to give it up. \n\nI also want to make my website have more stuff on it\n[https://benborgers.com/posts/library], like notes from classes I’m taking\n[https://benborgers.com/posts/publishing-class-notes]. I think it’d be an\ninteresting archive to look back on. \n\nAn email newsletter is an idea that I’ve been kicking around for the past couple\nof days. \n\nLet’s take a step back. I write stuff on the internet for two reasons: \n\n * I like to have a record of my thinking from the past, and it makes me a\n   better writer. (This is the reason that you tell people.)\n * I like attention. (This is the reason that you usually refrain from sharing.)\n\nIt might sound like a joke (or maybe it doesn’t, if you have a certain\nimpression of me as a person), but I don’t think I write this purely for myself.\nI like the feeling that other people care enough to flick through my blog posts\nevery once in a while. It makes me feel heard. \n\nPlus, the possibility that other people will read the things I’m writing is\nmotivation to write every day. (Perhaps this is what people would call\n“accountability”.)\n\nSo I guess to be very honest, benborgers.com helps with the first goal, and\nTwitter and an email newsletter (would) help with the second goal. Nobody writes\nan email newsletter for themselves and not for other people — that defeats the\npurpose of email. \n\nBut I don’t think that’s necessarily a bad thing. I’m imagining that my email\nnewsletter would be a weekly update, just with a bit on what I’ve been up to and\nwhat I’ve posted on my website (new blog posts, new class notes, etc). Like a\nquick note from a friend, and an invitation to reply with what you’ve been up to\nrecently too. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe thing I’m worried about is having too many things. I don’t want to have to\nremember to keep up a Twitter, a blog, and a newsletter. I don’t want to add\nmore things to my plate. \n\nSo my instinct is to make Twitter serve the same function as my newsletter. To\npost a bunch of little updates there. \n\nBut somehow I don’t think that it fits as well. The newsletter is more personal\nand intimate, while Twitter is more of just the programmer side of me. Twitter\nis more show-and-tell, and benborgers.com/maybe a newsletter are more\nlongform-thoughts-and-feelings. \n\nPlus, I’m already doing two of those things currently (Twitter and my personal\nwebsite), so writing an extra thing per week seems doable. \n\nSo — maybe I’ll start a weekly update newsletter. Just for fun. And if no one\nsubscribes? That’s okay too.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","author_id":"1","created_at":"2022-04-13T00:34:02.000Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T01:32:11.000Z","published_at":"2022-04-13T01:32:11.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"62561d45358a99774fe11621","uuid":"7697ac15-a3a6-4300-957c-9cba868f41e5","title":"What is Tufts Doing?","slug":"what-is-tufts-doing","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolabmoreperfect/episodes/the-political-thicket\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Every student in college \"]]],[3,\"ul\",[[[0,[],0,\"Housing\"]],[[0,[0],1,\"We’re all boys grown tall\"]],[]]]],\"ghostVersion\":\"4.0\"}","html":"<p>Every student in college </p><ul><li>Housing</li><li><a href=\"https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolabmoreperfect/episodes/the-political-thicket\">We’re all boys grown tall</a></li><li></li></ul>","comment_id":"62561d45358a99774fe11621","plaintext":"Every student in college \n\n * Housing\n * We’re all boys grown tall\n   [https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolabmoreperfect/episodes/the-political-thicket]\n *","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"draft","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","author_id":"1","created_at":"2022-04-13T00:45:57.000Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T17:58:13.000Z","published_at":null,"custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"62561df7358a99774fe1162a","uuid":"30199434-4bb1-4979-9779-167f55dad1e9","title":"Podcasts Shape My Personality","slug":"podcasts-shape-my-personality","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"My First Million\"]]]],\"ghostVersion\":\"4.0\"}","html":"<p>My First Million</p>","comment_id":"62561df7358a99774fe1162a","plaintext":"My First Million","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"draft","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","author_id":"1","created_at":"2022-04-13T00:48:55.000Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T00:48:58.000Z","published_at":null,"custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"62571030358a99774fe11695","uuid":"d246ff2c-2258-48cc-a4da-53675a2ddbe4","title":"Tufts & Change Makers","slug":"change-makers","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}]],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[[\"em\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://maverickbyloganpaul.com/\"]],[\"strong\"]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"My roommate brought up the idea last night that Tufts often says they want you to become a change maker in the world, but that they don’t \"],[0,[0],1,\"really\"],[0,[],0,\" want you to be a change maker if that change creates an existential threat to the university. \"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"If you became such a good change maker through your Tufts education that you moved the world away from higher education, the university wouldn’t be such a fan of you being a change maker anymore. \"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"But I don’t think that’s unreasonable.

And I could sit down once every couple\ndays and write through a couple blog post ideas, instead of needing to switch\ncontexts so often.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","author_id":"1","created_at":"2022-04-18T22:30:18.000Z","updated_at":"2022-04-18T22:40:58.000Z","published_at":"2022-04-18T22:40:58.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"626004d3358a99774fe11921","uuid":"b93521e2-0ca7-4298-abac-4e4023110104","title":"Silicon Valley credit music / comedic cuts like in Memories of Murder","slug":"silicon-valley-credit-music-comedic-cuts-like-in-memories-of-murder","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"ghostVersion\":\"4.0\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"\"]]]]}","html":null,"comment_id":"626004d3358a99774fe11921","plaintext":null,"feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"draft","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","author_id":"1","created_at":"2022-04-20T13:04:19.000Z","updated_at":"2022-04-20T13:04:19.000Z","published_at":null,"custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"626055c1358a99774fe1192b","uuid":"728db267-5fee-44b0-aabc-99440d77b8ec","title":"Instagram’s Lifespan","slug":"instagram","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Me and the people around me got Instagram in middle or high school.

You write something and publish it, but the expectation is that it’ll\nchange. You’ll keep updating it to make it incrementally more correct or more\ncomlete. \n\nI like the idea a lot. It encourages just publishing something instead of being\nfearful of pressing publish, which makes a lot of sense. But in practice,\nrecently, I’ve found the opposite to be more helpful for me. \n\nThe fact that I need to write a blog post every day encourages me to publish. I \nhave to publish something if I want to hit that daily goal. I can’t dwell too\nmuch on whether something is perfect or not — by the time the daily deadline\nhits, I have to be done. \n\nI do sometimes shy away from writing “bigger” posts that I want to get right —\nfor example, posts about projects I’ve built in the past that I’ll want to link\nto from my portfolio or resume.
