Hi! I'm Ben Borgers. I'm a [[grade-12/index, high school senior]] in Boston, and interned at IBM last summer. Next fall, I'm headed to [[applying-to-college/tufts, Tufts University]] to study computer science.

I'm on [twitter](https://twitter.com/benborgers) and [github](https://github.com/benborgers). If you wanna get in touch, I love getting emails: benborgers@hey.com

I want to keep a bit of a digital garden here of things I do, from [[applying-to-college, applying to college]] a couple months ago to [[black-mirror/index, rewatching _Black Mirror_]] and writing a bit about each episode.

More to come (hopefully).
