Hi! I'm Ben Borgers. I'm a [[grade-12/index, high school senior]] in Boston, and interned at IBM last summer. Next fall, I'm headed to [[applying-to-college/tufts, Tufts University]] to study computer science.

I'm on [twitter](https://twitter.com/benborgers) and [github](https://github.com/benborgers), and have [a newsletter](https://cornflakes.app/subscribe/0c199cfb-75d7-40ff-8866-f0e77d0b7072) if youâ€™re interested in what I'm up to. If you wanna get in touch, I love getting emails: benborgers@hey.com

On this website, I want to keep a bit of a digital garden. ==Any link surrounded by [\[double brackets]] is a link to another page of writing.== There's pages ranging from [[applying-to-college/index, applying to college]] a couple months ago to [[black-mirror/index, rewatching _Black Mirror_]].

I really like doing personal programming projects:

- [Cornflakes](https://cornflakes.app), a simple and privacy-focused email newsletter tool.
- [[blocks/index]], an app for my high school's schedule used by 2,000 students and teachers.
- [Bagel Institute](https://bagel.institute), tools for more interactive college teaching.
- ~[Underline](https://underline.email), a dead-simple and affordable way to run an email newsletter~.
- [Potion](https://github.com/benborgers/potion), an open-source reverse-engineered API for the Notion note taking app.
- [EMOJICDN](https://emojicdn.elk.sh), an API for getting images of emojis that serves two million requests per month.

Some past work:

- [Diyi](https://diyiboston.com), a payment and student management system for an online school in Boston.
- A software engineering internship at IBM Security in the summers of 2019 and 2020, working on a new security offering for enterprise.
- [Rep.ly](https://rep.ly), where I implemented new features on this public Q&A platform by Dip.
- Built [an app for Sophrosyne](https://sophrosyne.now.sh), a mental health awareness club.
