To cut to the chase: I was accepted to Tufts University for Early Decision! That means I retracted my application to Boston University below, and didn't apply anywhere else.

Also, here's my [[applying-to-college/common-app]].

## Tufts
_Applied October 18, 2020_

This is my Early Decision application. I wrote my [[applying-to-college/tufts]] in September on the car ride to and from Vermont, and got the application done pretty early.

## Boston University
_Applied November 21, 2020_

This was the next school I applied to, since their scholarship deadline was December 1st. Here are my [[applying-to-college/bu]].

## Watson Scholarship

Scholarship through IBM, which involves writing these [[applying-to-college/watson-scholarship]].
