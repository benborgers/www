title: "Brave New World Essay: What’s Your Soma?"

In _Brave New World_, soma exists to keep people happy and keep them doing what they should be doing. If there’s any inconvenience, pain, or unsightly scene, it can be papered over by taking a dose of soma.

There’s probably a lot of people who are writing that TikTok is modern soma, but I think that there’s “soma” involved in the _content creation_ side of TikTok as well.

I came across an old interview with Alex Zhu, the founder of Musical.ly and later head of TikTok, over the summer. In it, he described building a user base on Musical.ly as founding a new country — “America”. There are already lots of countries, lots of social media platforms that people are on. So why should they immigrate to America? You give them the American Dream.

You make your new app a land of possibility. One where anyone can achieve fame, where your social standing when you immigrate doesn’t limit your possibilities. As an app, you can do this by pushing some of your earliest creators to the top — Charli D’Amelio comes to mind as an example of this, even though Zhu wasn’t talking about TikTok at the time. You create celebrities out of thin air, out of people who weren’t remarkably well-known before. You need to show people that coming to your new app means that they can achieve fame, and your app’s homegrown celebrities become beacons of hope that attract the masses.

The problem is, once people arrive at your new app, they quickly realize that it isn’t the land of possibility you had promised. Sure, some people are becoming extremely famous, but not everybody can be famous. So now you’ve gotten people to come over to your app — how do you make them stay?

This is where the soma comes in. Like in _Brave New World_, you need to avoid the people experiencing difficulty. For Musical.ly (and by extension TikTok), the solution is to occasionally make random users’ videos go viral when they’re high-quality enough. Zhu flat-out says this in a surprisingly candid way: by making people go viral every once in a while, you keep their dreams alive. They don’t have to face the reality that the vast majority of people will never reach the top of TikTok, because they’ve been placated for the moment. They keep creating content on the app, and their “American Dream” doesn’t die.

There’s similarities between Zhu and Mustapha Mond. Both of them control vast communities of people, and understand acutely what it takes to keep them happy. They also don’t mince words around how they do this — for Zhu, it’s keeping the dream of virality alive; that posting on TikTok means the possibility of unbelievable success. For Mond, he plainly lays out that “if anything should go wrong, there’s soma” (220). Mond is highly aware that soma is required to keep order and stability in his society. These men have both found ways to keep their people happy and productive, so the world that the “controllers” have built can hold together for another day.
