title: Blocks
---

In the summer between sophomore and junior year of high school, I built an app for my school's new and confusing 6-day rotating schedule called "Blocks". It unexpectedly took off, with over 1,000 students and teachers using it.

In the summer between junior and senior year, I kept a tight watch on the new hybrid schedule with COVID-19, and re-built the app from scratch. In my senior year, 2,000 students used the app with consistently over 90% weekly active users.

It's been a humbling experience for so many people to find something I made useful, enough to use it every day.
