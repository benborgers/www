- **Work** and **energy** are both measured in Joules ($$J$$).
    - This makes sense because work is a quantification of how much energy is transferred from one form to another.
        - If you're doing work to something, you're changing the number of Joules of energy that object has.
- **Work** is the amount of energy transferred by a force when it moves an object through a displacement.
    - Work refers to energy transfers - putting energy into something or removing it.
    - **Energy** is the ability of an object to produce a change in itself or its environment.
        - For example, an item has the energy to crash into the wall, or a stretched rubber band has the stored energy to snap back.
    - **Mechanical energy** is a specific type of energy due to position or motion.
    - Work does not have a direction, but it does have a sign (which represents adding energy vs. removing energy).
        - Positive work occurs when force and displacement are in the same direction (example: throwing a ball). Negative work occurs when the force and displacement are in opposite directions (catching a ball).
        - There can be zero work, for example riding a skateboard. Force goes downwards while the displacement is horizontal. This makes sense, because the skateboard's energy is not affected by the skateboard pulling down.
        - There is also zero work if the object is not moving (zero displacement).
    - You do more work if:
        - You apply more force.
        - That force is applied over a greater displacement.
    - $$\text{work} = (\text{force component in direction of displacement})(\text{displacement})$$
        - The units make sense: $$J = N * m$$
        - This equation applies to mechanical energy, so:
            - Kinetic energy (energy due to motion)
            - Potential energy (stored energy, such as gravity or elastic)

# Equations

- Kinetic energy: $$\text{KE} = \frac{1}{2} mv ^2$$
    - if a ball is falling towards the ground, two things would give it more energy transfer to the ground: more mass (heavier ball) and more speed (the faster it goes).
- Net-work: $$W_\text{net} = K - K_0$$
    - The net-work done on a system is equal to its change in kinetic energy.
- Gravitational Potential Energy ($$\text{GPE}$$, or $$\text{PE}_\text{g}$$, or $$\text{U}_\text{g}$$. $$\text{U}$$ is a generic variable for different kinds of potential energy): $$\text{U}_{g} = m g h$$
    - Things that increase gravitational potential energy: mass, gravity, and height from which the object falls.
    - Not dependent on the path taken, only the final position.
