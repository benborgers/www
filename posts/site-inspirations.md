title: Inspirations for This Site

I was inspired to buy the domain *ben.city* and create this "loose notes" website on October 29, 2020 after stumbling across [this page](https://adamcap.com/schoolwork/3000/) of Adam Cap's website. I was googling for answers to my physics homework.

I'm also greatly inspired by [Andy Matuschak's working notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/), which are vast and you easily get lost in them.

Other sources of inspiration for a personal website of writing are [arcana dot computer](https://arcana.computer) and [Jonnie Hallman](https://destroytoday.com).

The double-bracket linking between pages is, of course, inspired by [Roam Research](http://roamresearch.com/).
