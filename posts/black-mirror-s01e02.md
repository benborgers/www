# Plot

Bing Madsen lives in a dull world, where each person has their own room surrounded by screens and leaves it daily to ride a stationary bike and earn "merits", which are used to pay for daily life. 

After overhearing Abi Khan singing in the toilets, he convinces her to enter *Hot Shot*, a talent show whose winners live much better lives. He offers to buy her ticket using merits from his deceased brother. It costs him 15 million merits, nearly his entire fortune. 

Bing goes with Abi to the audition, where she sings for the judges. The judges say that they like her singing, but that there are so many singers that she doesn't stand out. Instead, the judges and the audience pressure her into taking a spot on one of the judge's pornography channel, *WraithBabes*. 

While in his room, Bing sees an advertisement for *WraithBabes* that features Abi. He cannot afford the merits to skip it, and the ad plays high-pitched noises when he closes his eyes to force him to watch it. In frustration, Bing smashes the screens that make up the walls of his room and hides one of the shards under his bed. 

Bing becomes completely obsessed with earning 15 million merits again, taking other people's food when it becomes stuck in the vending machines to save money. He buys a *Hot Shot* ticket and hides the shard in his waistband. 

On stage, he begins with a dance number, but then pulls out the shard and threatens to slice his own neck if he isn't given an opportunity to speak. Bing passionately rants about the heartless, artificial system they live under. 

One of the judges declares the speech the greatest act in *Hot Shot* history and offers Bing a his own regular shot on one of the judge's channels. 

Later, Bing is shown livestreaming his show. He performs holding the shard to his neck, but rants both about grievances with the system and advertisements *for* the system. 

After ending his weekly stream, we see that his living quarters are now quite large, and the episode ends with him looking out from his room onto a beautiful forest view.
