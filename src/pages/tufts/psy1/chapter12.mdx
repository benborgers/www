## Psychodynamic Theories of Personality

- Freud’s theories were **psychodynamic**: explanations of behavior and personality in terms of energy dynamics within the individual. 
	- Today’s psychodynamic theories differ from Freudian theory, but emphasize unconscious processes and that adult personality stems from childhood experiences. 
	- Freud’s theory:
		- Three major systems: id, ego, superego
			- **id**: primitive motives to obtain pleasure and avoid pain
			- **ego**: a referee between what instinct wants and what society demands
				- Slows down id’s desire for sex and aggression until a suitable / socially appropriate outlet can be found
			- **superego**: voice of conscience, learned sense of morality
				- Judges activities of the id
				- Partly conscious but largely unconscious
		- Healthy personality means keeping these three systems in balanced
	- **Defense mechanisms** according to Freud:
		- Repression
			- Like repressing a memory
		- Projection
			- Projecting your feelings on someone else
		- Displacement
			- Taking out your anger on someone / something
			- *Sublimation*: transforming “bad” urges into positive or productive activities
		- Regression
			- Reverting to a previous state of psychological development
		- Denial
			- Refusing to admit that something unpleasant is happening / they have a problem / they are feeling a forbidden emotion
	- Psychodynamic theories are lacking in multiple ways:
		- Impossible to confirm or disconfirm (violating _principle of falsifiability_)
		- They draw universal principals from the experiences of a few atypical patients
		- They base theories of personality development on the retrospective accounts of adults
	- Freud was not an impartial scientist, and ignored evidence disconfirming his ideas. 
	- However, Freud welcomed women into the profession, recognized society’s suppression of female sexuality, and argued that homosexuality was nothing to be ashamed of. 
	- Carl Jung argued that human beings share a vast **collective unconscious**, containing universal memories and stories, including symbols (**archetypes**). 


## The Modern Study of Personality

- Personality tests need *validity* (they measure what they’re supposed to) and *reliability* (consistency) to be scientific. 
- Myers-Briggs Type Indicator test does not have *reliability*, and its results don’t predict a person’s behavior on the job or in relationships. 
- **Factor analysis:** identifying clusters (for example, in personality traits). 
- Big Five (“robust factors” of personality): 
	- Openness
	- Conscientiousness
	- Extraversion
	- Agreeableness
	- Neuroticism


## Genetic Influences on Personality

- Babies are born with a genetically influenced **temperament** (including *reactivity* and *soothability*). 
- Animals (even like octopi) have discernible personalities. 


## Environmental Influences on Personality

- People can have a core set of stable traits but their behavior can vary across situations. 
	- **Reciprocal determinism:** the two-way interaction between the environment and personality traits. 
- **Nonshared environment:** any unique and chance experiences that are not shared with other family members. 
	- e.g. being in school play; being bullied
- What parents do profoundly affects the quality of their relationship with their children (whether children feel loved, secure, valued, or humiliated, frightened, worthless). 
- However, parents have less influence on a child’s personality than one may assume. 
	- Also, because of **reciprocal determinism**, children also affect parents. 
- Usually, peers’ views win out over parents’ views. 


## Cultural Influences on Personality

- Cultural background influences who you are. 
	- **Individualist cultures:** independence of the individual takes precedence over the needs of the group, and the self is defined as a collection of personality traits. 
	- **Collectivist cultures:** group harmony takes precedence over the wishes of the individual, the self is defined in the context of relationships and the community. 
- Americans tend to value “being true to yourself” and having a “core identity”, while other cultures perceive their sense of self changing 90-99% depending on the situation. 


## The Inner Experience

- **Humanist psychology:** a movement to replace psychoanalysis and behaviorism with an approach that emphasizes our uniquely human capacity to determine our own actions and futures. 
- Maslow thought that psychology ignored positive experiences of life. 
- Carl Rogers (clinician) said that we need **unconditional positive regard** (unconditional love and support for the people we are) to become fully functioning people. 
	- *Conditional positive regard:* “I will love you if you behave well, and I won’t love you if you behave badly.” 
		- Adults often treat each other like this. 
- **Existentialism:** philosophical approach that emphasizes the inevitable dilemmas and challenges of human existence. 
	- European philosophy brought to America by Rollo May. 
- Humanist theories have not received much attention from laypeople in society at large.
