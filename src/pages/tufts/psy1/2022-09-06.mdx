**Psychology is the study of behavior.**

Answering questions from the online textbook is **retrieval practice**, which has been shown to be effective.

## What has psychology done for me lately? 

### Sleep deprivation

Sleep deprivation’s effects: 

- Reduced brain activity (e.g. frontal cortex)
- Increased stress hormones (e.g. cortisol) which makes people irritable and anxious
- Increased amygdala activation (sets off stress and fight or flight response)
- Decreased activity in the hippocampus
- Decreased concentration
- Mood swings
- Hallucinations, visual and auditory (if sleep deprivation is extreme — 2-3 days)

Hartmann & Pritchard (2018): More sleep disturbance correlates with more courses dropped and a lower GPA. 

### First impressions

We form first impressions all the time, especially in college. 

- Snap judgements we make converge with information that others tell us based on more solid information. 
- They save us time.
- They often do pick up on meaningful info. 
- But they can be problematic (based on preconceived notions). 
- Humans don’t like admitting they’re wrong, so snap judgements are highly resistant to change. 
- They can become a self-fulfilling prophecy: they change how we behave towards someone else, and then they behave differently towards us.
