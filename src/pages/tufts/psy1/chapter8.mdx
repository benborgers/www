## Motivation

- **Intrinsic motivation**: motivation for the activity’s own sake. 
- **Extrinsic motivation**: motivation due to external rewards. 

## The Biology of Weight

- **Set point**: an individual’s genetically influenced weight range. 

## Environmental Influences on Weight

1. Abundant access to fast and processed foods. 
2. Increased portions in the U.S. 
3. High-sugar, high-calorie soft drinks. 
4. Decline in exercise (screens, desk jobs). 
5. Highly varied diets. 
	- When diets are predictable, people habituate and eat less. 


## Eating Disorders

- **Bulimia nervosa**: person binges (eats a lot), feels out of control, then purges (vomiting / laxatives). 
	- Rare in non-Western cultures; correlated with rise in thin ideal for women. 
- **Anorexia nervosa**: person hardly eats and becomes dangerously thin. 

Genes play a role in the development of eating disorders, but so do anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, and distorted body image. 


## The Biology of Love

- *Vasopressin* and *oxytocin*: hormones that play a crucial role in social bonding. 
	- Oxytocin causes people to attach to those close to them, but be defensive to those outside the group. 


## The Psychology of Love

- Adults’ attachment styles (*secure*, *anxious*, *avoidant*) derive from how they were treated as a child. 
- In cultures where it is unmasculine to express emotion, men express their love by taking compassionate actions. 


## Biology of Sexual Orientation

- The more older brothers you have, the more likely you are to be gay. 
	- Hypothesis: mothers are more likely in subsequent pregnancies to develop an immune response against a substance important to male brain development. 


## Motivations for Rape

- Narcissism and hostility towards women. 
- A desire to dominate, humiliate, or punish the victim. 
- Sadism (getting pleasure from inflicting pain). 


## Goals

- **Performance goals**: goals based on performing well or being judged favorably. 
	- People who fail are more likely to conclude that the fault is in them as a person. 
- **Mastery goals**: goals based on improving a skill or finding intrinsic pleasure in what you’re learning. 
- **Self-efficacy**: confidence; belief that one is capable of acquiring a new skill. 


## The Pursuit of Happiness

- People motivated by intrinsic satisfaction are happier than people motivated by money. 
- *Experiences* make people more satisfied than having *things*.
