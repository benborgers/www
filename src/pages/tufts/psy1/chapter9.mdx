## Perspectives in Studying Emotion

- **Discrete Perspective**
	- There are a limited number of emotional states. 
	- Basic emotional states: anger, fear, happiness, sadness, disgust, surprise. 
- **Dimensional Perspective**
	- Two axes: arousal (how energized) and valence (negativity to positivity)

## Emotion and the Face

- Infants display facial emotions, but they have to learn how to decode them on others. 
	- Happens at 6-7 months. 
- Facial expressions can influence emotions (i.e. smiling can make you happy). 

## Emotion and the Brain

- The amygdala evaluates sensory emotion and is therefore sometimes responsible for emotion. 
- The cortex can override the amygdala with more accurate information. 
	- Inhibits the amygdala. 
- **Mirror neurons**: when you see someone do something, the same neurons fire in your brain. 
	- Other people’s emotions can “rub off” on us. 


## Emotion and the Mind

- Emotion depends on arousal and *how you interpret that arousal*. 
	- Emotions are created and influenced by **appraisals**, how you interpret your and other people’s behavior. 


## Communicating Emotions 

- **Display rules**: how you’re allowed to display emotion in your culture. 
- **Emotion work**: expressing an emotion we don’t really feel because we feel like we should be. 


## Measuring Emotion in Studies

- Self-report on a rating scale
- Measuring temperature
- Measuring skin conductance
- Measuring muscles in the face


## Gender and Emotion

- Men and women feel the same emotions, but women express negative emotions more than men in public (except for anger, which men express more, especially towards other men). 


## How do we regulate emotions?

- Situation selection
- Situation modification
- Attentional deployment (e.g. distraction)
- Cognitive change (e.g. reappraisal)
- Response modulation (e.g. suppression)


## Phases of Stress

1. *alarm phase*: body mobilizes to meet a threat (“fight or flight”). 
2. *resistance phase*: body attempts to resist a stressor that cannot be avoided. 
3. *exhaustion phase*: persistent stress depletes the body’s energy. 


## Stress and the Body

- Medulla (in adrenal glands) releases epinephrine and norepinephrine. 
- **HPA axis (hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal cortex)** releases chemical messengers to the pituitary gland, which sends messages to the cortex of the adrenal glands to secrete **cortisol** (elevates blood sugar, protects body’s tissues from inflammation in case of injury). 
	- Results in increased energy. 
	- Elevated cortisol causes people to seek out more calories and fat. 
		- May explain why people of lower socioeconomic status are generally in worse health. 
- Stress can suppress parts of the immune system. 
- Stress may shorten telomeres. 

## Stress and the Mind

- People who believe they have control over their own outcomes have an easier time resisting viral infection than people who think it’s luck or fate. 


## Hostility and Depression

- People who are hostile (mistrustful of others, willing to start arguments) are at higher risk for heart disease.
- Depression can lead to heart disease (via elevated cortisol → weight gain; via smoking/drinking/lack of exercise; via inflammation and increased risk of blood clots). 

## Emotional Inhibition 

- “Confessing” your emotions leads to better health. 
- When people rehearse grievances and hold grudges, their blood pressure, heart rate, and skin conductance rise. 
	- Forgiveness = coming to terms with the injustice and letting go of obsessive feelings of hurt, rage, and vengefulness. 


## Coping with Stress

- Mindfulness meditation
- Exercise

### Rethinking the problem (if it can’t be solved)

- *Reappraisal*: change how you think about the problem. 
- Learn from the experience. 
- Make social comparisons (to people who have it worse).
