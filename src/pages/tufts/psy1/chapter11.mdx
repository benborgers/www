## Social Beliefs

- **Attribution theory**: people are motivated to explain their own or others’ behaviors by attributing their causes to situations or dispositions. 
	- *Situational attribution*: attributing to a situation. 
	- *Dispositional attribution*: attributing to the person inherently. 
- **Fundamental attribution error**: the common tendency to over-attribute to personality factors and under-attribute to the situation. 
	- Particularly prevalent in Western countries, where people think that individuals are responsible for their own actions and dislike the idea that situations have influence. 
- Biases:
	- We think we’re better than average (**better-than-average effect**).
	- We think the world is fair (**just-world hypothesis**).
		- One common way of restoring this is *victim blaming*. 
- **Familiarity effect**: the tendency to hold positive attitudes towards familiar people or things. 
	- Comfort foods, familiar smells, recognizable commercial jingles. 
- **Elaboration likelihood model**
	- When we have motivation / available cognitive resources to scrutinize a message, we are more persuaded by the strength of arguments. 
		- *Central route to persuasion*
		- When we are lacking in motivation or cognitive resources (busy, distracted, tired) we are more persuaded by superficial things (celebrity spokesperson, the attractiveness of the person making the argument). 
			- *Peripheral route to persuasion*
- **Cognitive dissonance**: the uncomfortable feeling when two attitudes or an attitude and a behavior are in conflict. 
	- We need to tell ourselves things to keep cognitive dissonance in balance, and sometimes dismiss evidence to do this. 
- Methods of indoctrination (e.g. suicide bombers, cults): 
	- Change their behavior slowly
	- Provide and emphasize one reason for the person’s problems
	- Control their access to disconfirming / dissonant information (family, internet, etc)


## Social Forces

- **Norms**: rules for how to act in society. 
- **Roles**: positions in society that are regulated by norms. 
- Those who justify their own actions often mentally hand over responsibility to authority figures, while those who “do the right thing” take responsibility for their own actions. 


## Individuals in Groups

- **Groupthink**: the tendency for a group to think alike and suppress dissent. 
	- Symptoms of groupthink:
		- An illusion of invulnerability
		- Self-censorship
		- Pressure on dissenters to conform
		- An illusion of unanimity
	- Groupthink can be minimized when leaders reward expressions of doubt or dissent
- **Bystander effect**: the more people around you, the *less* likely someone will help you. 
- **Deindividuation**: losing awareness of your individuality in a crowd; may do destructive things you’d never do on your own. 
	- This is responsible for mob violence
- Factors that help people overcome bystander apathy:
	- You perceive the need for intervention or help
	- Cultural norms encourage you to take action
	- You have an ally


## Group Identity and Conflict

- **Social identities**: comprised of groups we belong to, feel emotionally attached to, and are influenced by their rules, values, and norms. 
- **In-group favoritism**: being more generous (both in thought and deed) with others in your own group. 
- You can undo artificially-created group hostility by having the groups cooperate or pool resources. 
- **Stereotype**: summary impression of a group. 

## Prejudice

- **Prejudice**: strong, unreasonable dislike or hatred of a group. 
- Sources of prejudice: 
	- Psychological - prejudice can ward off doubt, fear, and low self-esteem, and allows scapegoating
	- Social - acquired through friends, relatives, etc
	- Economic - justified by a group’s perceived dominance, status, or wealth
	- Cultural or national - people bond with people in their own ethnic group
