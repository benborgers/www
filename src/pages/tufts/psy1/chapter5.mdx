**Learning**: a relatively enduring change in behavior resulting from experience. 

## New Reflexes from Old

- **Unconditioned response (UR)**: the natural response that doesn’t require additional learning. 
- **Conditioned response (CR)**: when a neutral (normal) stimulus becomes a **conditioned stimulus (CS)** and starts to elicit a specific response. 
	- Example: Pavlov’s dogs
- **Classical conditioning** has two phases: 
	- Acquisition (conditioned stimulus + conditioned response)
	- Extinction (conditioned stimulus + _no_ conditioned response)
		- This is when the animal stops doing it, because they’re learning new rules about the world

## A Learning to Like

- **Behaviorism**: an approach that emphasizes studying behavior, and the role of the environment as determinants of future behavior. 
- **Counterconditioning**: using conditioning to treat a fear or anxiety. 
	- This learning is done in the brain by the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)
		- The vmPFC inhibits the amygdala
- The body is more prone to associating bad tastes with sickness. 
	- This probably evolved as a way to avoid eating poisonous food. 
- Some cancer patients develop a conditioned anxiety response to anything associated with their chemotherapy. 

## Operant Conditioning

- **Operant conditioning**: the process by which a behavior becomes more or less likely to occur, depending on its consequences. 
- In classical conditioning, responses are generally automatic. In operant conditioning, responses are generally complex and not automatic. 
	- Classical conditioning = two stimuli; operant conditioning = stimulus and response
- **Reinforcement** strengthens the response. **Punishment** weakens the response. 
	- **Primary reinforcers**: food, water, comfortable temperature (biological needs). 
	- **Primary punishers**: pain, extreme heat, extreme cold (inherently and biologically punishing). 
	- **Secondary reinforcers**: money, praise, applause. 
	- **Secondary punishers**: criticism, fines, bad grades. 


## Principles of Operant Conditioning

- It’s a mistake to even sometimes reinforce the behavior, because the organism will learn that the behavior still works sometimes. 
- **Shaping**: reinforce an existing tendency in the right direction until it’s the behavior you want. 

## B.F. Skinner

- Believed that thoughts and feelings can’t explain behavior. 
- Behaviors simply occur because of reinforcement or punishment. 
- Believed that free will is an illusion. 

## Punishment

- The severity of criminal punishments doesn’t matter, just the consistency. 
- Punishment is a poor way to eliminate behaviors. 
	- Punishment often doesn’t happen soon enough after the transgression.
	- The punishment doesn’t contain information about what was done wrong. 
	- The punishment may reinforce the behavior (yelling at a toddler throwing a tantrum gives them the attention they were seeking). 
	- Punishments are associated with children becoming more aggressive and antisocial over time. 

## Reward

- When people are paid for an activity, they’re more likely to view it as work and to only spend the minimum amount of time on it. 


## Learning and the Mind

- **Latent learning**: when a person learns something but doesn’t apply it or realize they’ve learned it until much later. 
- **Social-cognitive theory**: all theories that combine behavior principals with cognitive principles to explain behavior in a social context. 
- **Observational learning**: learning by seeing someone else do something. 
	- It’s more effective when the person you’re observing is of the same racial or social group.
