## Circadian Rhythms

- **Biological Rhythms**: period fluctuations in a biological system. 
	- Affect urine volume, blood pressure, etc. 
	- Can be affected by time, daylight, temperature, etc. 
- **Circadian Rhythms**: rhythms that happen every 24 hours. 
	- Example: sleep/wake cycle. 
	- **Suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)**: biological clock, located in hypothalamus
		- Sensitive to change in light
	- Jet lag is when sleep/wake patterns are out of sync with temperature and hormone cycles. 
	- Women retroactively assign more mood swings to their menstrual cycle than in-the-moment journals they write actually attest to


## Stages of Sleep

This sequence takes 30-45 minutes:

- Stage 1: small and irregular brain waves, you drift into light sleep. 
- Stage 2: the brain emits occasional short bursts of rapid high-peaking waves called *sleep spindles*. 
- Stage 3/4: brain emits *delta waves* (very slow waves with very high peaks). Muscles are relaxed. Deep sleep. 

Then you go from Stage 3/4 to 2 to 1. Then you enter **REM sleep**: the brain is extremely active but the body is not. 

REM/non-REM cycles go back and forth for the night, with REM periods getting longer and closer together. 

## Why We Sleep

## Sleeping disorders

- **Sleep apnea**: breathing ceases for a moment while the person is sleeping. 
	- Can cause high blood pressure and irregular heartbeat. 
- **Narcolepsy**: person lapses into 5-30 mins of REM sleep during the day. 


## Benefits of sleep

- Sleep is crucial for **consolidation**, where synaptic changes associated with recently stored memories become durable and stable. 
	- One theory is that the neurons activated during the original experience are re-activated, consolidating the memory and moving it from the hippocampus to long-term storage in the cortex. 

## Dreams

- Dreams can reflect ongoing problems in life. 
- Dreams can be modifications of thinking activity that happens during the day. 
- **Activation-synthesis theory**: dreams can the result of neurons firing in the lower part of the brain (*pons*) during REM sleep, and then they are interpreted despite having no meaning. 
	- The brain creates meaning where there is none. 

### Why we forget dreams

The cortical neurons that control the initial storage of new memories are turned off during sleep, so we often can’t remember dreams for very long. 

## Hypnosis

Hypnosis is in the expectations: if you tell them that pedaling on a bike will hypnotize them, it may work. 

- Some people are more responsive / accepting of hypnosis than others, and it works better on them. 
- Hypnosis can boost the amount of memories recalled, but also increases errors. 
- Hypnosis has been used to treat pain, anxiety, obesity, asthma, etc. 

Modern theory of hypnosia: the system in the brain that interprets information hands over its function to the hypnotist, and takes its instructions on how it should interpret the world and act in it. 

## Drugs

- **Stimulants** speed up activity in the central nervous system. 
- **Depressants** slow down the central nervous system, and make someone calm or drowsy. 
	- Alcohol suppresses parts of the brain that normally inhibit behavior. 
- **Opiates** relieve pain, and have the same effect on the brain that endorphins do. 
- **Psychadelics** disrupt normal thought processes, such as the perception of time and space. 

## The effects of a drug can also depend on:

- Past experiences with the drug (and whether they were positive/negative). 
- Circadian rhythms / time of day when drug is taken.
- Emotional setting (at home vs. at a party). 
- Motives for taking a drug.
