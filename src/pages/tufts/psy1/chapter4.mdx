## Consciousness and the Brain

- The **Reticular Activating System (RAS)** controls consciousness. When stimulated, the brain wakes up. When inhibited, you sleep. 

## Circadian Rhythms

- **Biological Rhythms**: period fluctuations in a biological system.
  - Affect urine volume, blood pressure, etc.
  - Can be affected by time, daylight, temperature, etc.
- **Circadian Rhythms**: rhythms that happen every 24 hours.
  - Example: sleep/wake cycle.
  - **Suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)**: biological clock, located in hypothalamus
    - Sensitive to change in light
  - Jet lag is when sleep/wake patterns are out of sync with temperature and hormone cycles.
  - Women retroactively assign more mood swings to their menstrual cycle than in-the-moment journals they write actually attest to

## Stages of Sleep

As you fall asleep:

- Beta waves (awake)
- Alpha waves (relaxed, eyes closed)

This sequence takes 30-45 minutes:

- Stage 1: small and irregular brain waves, you drift into light sleep.
- Stage 2: the brain emits occasional short bursts of rapid high-peaking waves called _sleep spindles_, and other waves called K-complexes.
	- Sleep spindles are related to memory and learning. 
	- K-complexes respond to sound but let you keep sleeping if the sound isn’t a threat. 
- Stage 3/4: brain emits _delta waves_ (very slow waves with very high peaks). Muscles are relaxed. Deep sleep.
	- Slow wave sleep. 

Then you go from Stage 3/4 to 2 to 1. Then you enter **REM sleep**: the brain is extremely active but the body is not.

- REM = fast, low-amplitude, high-frequency waves.
- During REM, muscles are paralyzed so you don’t act out your dreams. 

REM/non-REM cycles go back and forth for the night, with REM periods getting longer and closer together.

## Why We Sleep

- Sleep conserves energy. 
- Sleep restores the body. 
	- The brain washes itself with cerebrespinal fluid (CSF). 
	- **Amyloid lata**, a protein that builds up in the hippocampus and thalmus, is removed
- Helps with learning and memory. 

## Sleeping disorders

- **Sleep apnea**: breathing ceases for a moment while the person is sleeping.
  - Can cause high blood pressure and irregular heartbeat.
- **Narcolepsy**: person lapses into 5-30 mins of REM sleep during the day.

## Benefits of sleep

- Sleep is crucial for **consolidation**, where synaptic changes associated with recently stored memories become durable and stable.
  - One theory is that the neurons activated during the original experience are re-activated, consolidating the memory and moving it from the hippocampus to long-term storage in the cortex.

## Dreams

- Dreams can reflect ongoing problems in life.
- Dreams can be modifications of thinking activity that happens during the day.
- **Activation-synthesis theory**: dreams can the result of neurons firing in the lower part of the brain (_pons_) during REM sleep, and then they are interpreted despite having no meaning.
  - The brain creates meaning where there is none.

### Why we forget dreams

The cortical neurons that control the initial storage of new memories are turned off during sleep, so we often can’t remember dreams for very long.

## Hypnosis

Hypnosis is in the expectations: if you tell them that pedaling on a bike will hypnotize them, it may work.

- Some people are more responsive / accepting of hypnosis than others, and it works better on them.
- Hypnosis can boost the amount of memories recalled, but also increases errors.
- Hypnosis has been used to treat pain, anxiety, obesity, asthma, etc.

Modern theory of hypnosia: the system in the brain that interprets information hands over its function to the hypnotist, and takes its instructions on how it should interpret the world and act in it.

## Meditation

- A lot of forms of meditation want to get you to “restful alertness”. 
- **Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction** (a popular type of meditation that’s often studied) has been shown to lower stress. 
- Meditation increases gray matter in the brain, and decreases amygdala activation. 
- ikely a lot of benefits associated with meditation result from the lowered stress. 

## Drugs

- **Stimulants** speed up activity in the central nervous system.
- **Depressants** slow down the central nervous system, and make someone calm or drowsy.
  - Alcohol suppresses parts of the brain that normally inhibit behavior.
- **Opiates** relieve pain, and have the same effect on the brain that endorphins do.
- **Psychadelics** disrupt normal thought processes, such as the perception of time and space.

## The effects of a drug can also depend on:

- Past experiences with the drug (and whether they were positive/negative).
- Circadian rhythms / time of day when drug is taken.
- Emotional setting (at home vs. at a party).
- Motives for taking a drug.
