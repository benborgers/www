## Measuring Memory

- **Explicit memory**: intentional recollection of information. 
	- **Recall**: the ability to retrieve previous information. 
	- **Recognition**: the ability to identify information you’ve seen before. 

## Models of Memory

- Memory moves from *sensory register* to *working memory* (~30 seconds unless you focus hard) to *long-term memory*.
	- **sensory register**: visuals retain for 0.5 seconds, auditory signals for up to 10 seconds
	- **working memory**: retains for 30 seconds
		- Remembering a sentence as it’s being spoken is remembered in “chunks”, not individual words. 
	- **long-term memory**: evidence suggests things are grouped by category (furniture, fruits). 
		- Explicit memory - hippocampus
			- **Semantic memory**: internal representations of the world. 
			- **Episodic memory**: internal representations of events you experienced. 
		- Implicit memory - striatum
- **Parallel distributed processing (PDP) model (connectionist model)**: memory is connections in a vast network of processing units. 


## The Biology of Memory

- In working memory, neurons temporarily alter their ability to release neurotransmitters. 
- In long-term memory, there are structural changes to the brain. 
	- **Long-term potentiation**: a long-lasting change to the strength of synaptic responsiveness as a result of long-term memory. 
- Hippocampus is critical to forming and recalling long-term memories. 
- Memories may be stored in the same places where they were originally perceived (when recalling a visual memory, the visual parts of the brain become active). 


## Hormones, Emotion, and Memory

- In traumatizing or stressful moments, hormones such as epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine are released, which enhance memory. 
	- Arousal tells the brain that this is important to remember. 
	- Hormones bind to amygdala, which signals hippocampus to increase memory incoding. 


## Rehearsal

**Rehearsal**: repeating information in your head until you remember it. 

- **Maintenance rehearsal**: rote repetition of material. 
- **Elaborative rehearsal**: associating new information with things you already have in your memory. 
- **Deep processing**: learning more about the meaning of something helps with memory. 


## Forgetting

Four ways of forgetting:

1. Decay
2. Replacement
3. Interference
	- **Retroactive interference**: recently learned material interferes with previously learned material. 
	- **Proactive interference**: material you learned before interferes with trying to remember new information. 
4. Cue-Dependent Forgetting
	- **Cue-dependent forgetting**: inability to retrieve stored information because of insufficient cues. 
	- “Tip of the tongue” is an example of this. 

## Forgetting your childhood

People don’t remember things before the age of 2. Why? 

1. Brain isn’t well-developed, and also may be focusing on *all* the new events and unable to focus on one event. 
2. Children don’t have a sense of self, and don’t have the language to encode their own experiences. 
3. Children don’t know what’s normal and what’s not, so they focus on ordinary things. 

## Repression

There isn’t much evidence that people can “repress” memories and completely forget about them. 

Instead, usually these people recall false memories because of the power of suggestion from a psychotherapist. 

## False Memories

DRM Paradigm: a way to study false memories. 

- False memories are correlated with:
	- Inconsistencies in people’s reports of past events. 
	- Reports of memories of past lives or alien abductions. 
	- **Age (old = more errors)**

Some false memories are caused by **spreading activation** of your semantic memory network — related things are activated. 

- False memories are more common than you think. 
- They often grow out of normal tendencies and processes (e.g. semantic memory). 

### Why do we get false memories?
- Memory is a constructive process - we fill in the edges. 
- We’re easily influenced. 
- Post-event information affects your memory.
