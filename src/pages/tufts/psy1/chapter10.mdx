## How did we get to where we are today? 

Nurture vs. nature - it’s both! 

- Tabula rasa (blank slate) → extreme nurture perspective
- Hard-wiring
	- Infants are startled by loud noises
	- Infants are surprised by physically improbable events (magic)
	- Infants can see (with very limited range)

## Prenatal Development

- At 4-8 weeks, male embryos’ rudimentary testes secrete testosterone. Otherwise, all embryos would be anatomically female. 
- Stressed mother → underweight babies with abnormal cortisol levels. 
- Father over 50 → higher risk of child with schizophrenia. 
- Teenage father → higher risk of premature babies or low birth weight. 

## The Infant’s World

- Babies are born with **motor reflexes**, such as searching for something to suck on. 
- How to study babies:
	- *Habituation*: show something over and over until it becomes a habit, then change the stimulus and see whether the baby can tell. 
	- *Preferential looking*: present two things and see which the baby looks at. 


## From Conception Through the First Year

- **Attachment**: strong, intimate, long-lasting bond (often first one is the mother). 
- **Separation anxiety**: around 6-8 months, babies become wary or fearful of strangers. 
- Predictors of insecure attachment:
	- Abandonment and deprivation in the first year
	- Abusive/erratic parenting
	- Genetics
	- Stressful family circumstanceS (parent is ill, etc)


## Thinking

- Babies *assimilate* (gather) and *accommodate* (make updates in response to new experiences) information. 

### Piaget’s Stage Model

- Sensorimotor Stage
	- Birth - 2 years
	- Month 1: all reflex
	- Months 2-4: accidents happen and get repeated
	- Months 4+: intentionally try to manipulate world
	- Year 2: trial and error
	- Takes until 15-18 months to differentiate self from others
	- Major skill: object permanence
- Preoperational Stage
	- Ages 2-7
	- Abstract thought (fantasty play)
- Concrete Operational Stage
	- Ages 7-12
	- Theory of Mind (put yourself in others’ perspective)
	- Actions are reversible
	- Focused on concrete, not abstract/hypothetical
- Formal Operations
	- Ages 12+
	- Abstract thought
	- Logically test hypotheses instead of trial and error
	- Can do long-term planning

#### Criticisms of Piaget

- Stage model assumes all children in stage are the same
- Some argue Piaget underestimated kids’ cognitive abilities
	- Kids seem to have some object permanence very young


## Language

- Children may have an innate mental module for language. 
	- Deaf children invent sign languages that show similar sentence structures to actual languages. 

## Morality

- *Preconventional* morality, not doing things for fear of punishment is seen in young children. 
- *Conventional* morality, based on conformity and approval of others as well as law, is seen around age 10+. 
- *Postconventional* morality, reasoned based on abstract principles and universal human rights, is seen in some adults. 


## Getting Children to be Good

- **Power assertion** (physical punishment, taking things away, “because I said so”) are not effective and can backfire (child becomes angry and resentful). 
- **Induction** (appealing to child’s own empathy and sense of responsibility) is more effective. 


### Parenting styles

- Authoritative
- Authoritarian
- Permissive
- Uninvolved


## The Physiology of Adolescence

- **Adrenarche**: ages 6-12, children’s adrenal glands pump out hormones that affect brain development, particularly an androgen called DHEA. 
	- Divert glucose to brain to mature brain regions important to interpreting social and emotional cues. 
- During puberty, synapses in the prefrontal cortex (impulse control and planning) are pruned. 


## Stages and Ages

- Trust vs mistrust
- Autonomy vs shame and doubt (young children learning to be autonomous without feeling too certain of their actions)
- Initiative vs guilt
- Competence vs inferiority (school age)
- Identity vs role confusion (adolescence)
- Intimacy vs isolation
- Generativity vs stagnation (middle adulthood - do you sink into complacency and selfishness?)
- Ego integrity vs dispair


## Cognitive Aging

- Cognitive deficits are observed in older individuals
	- Decreased working memory
	- Short-term memory declines more than long-term
- Good health and socially active predict positive cognitive abilities
- Some things improve:
	- Wisdom
	- Crystallized intelligence
