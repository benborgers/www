## Prenatal Development

- At 4-8 weeks, male embryos’ rudimentary testes secrete testosterone. Otherwise, all embryos would be anatomically female. 
- Stressed mother → underweight babies with abnormal cortisol levels. 
- Father over 50 → higher risk of child with schizophrenia. 
- Teenage father → higher risk of premature babies or low birth weight. 

## The Infant’s World

- Babies are born with **motor reflexes**, such as searching for something to suck on. 
- How to study babies:
	- *Habituation*: show something over and over until it becomes a habit, then change the stimulus and see whether the baby can tell. 
	- *Preferential looking*: present two things and see which the baby looks at. 


## From Conception Through the First Year

- **Attachment**: strong, intimate, long-lasting bond (often first one is the mother). 
- **Separation anxiety**: around 6-8 months, babies become wary or fearful of strangers. 
- Predictors of insecure attachment:
	- Abandonment and deprivation in the first year
	- Abusive/erratic parenting
	- Genetics
	- Stressful family circumstanceS (parent is ill, etc)


## Thinking

- Babies *assimilate* (gather) and *accommodate* (make updates in response to new experiences) information. 
- Birth - age 2: baby is in *sensorimotor stage*, learning through concrete actions (looking, touching, sucking, grasping). 
- *Preoperational stage*: ages 2-7, children cannot take another person’s point of view. 
	- This may not be 100% true. 
- *Concrete operations stage*: ages 7-12, can understand cause and effect, basic arithmetic, categorization, ordering. 
- *Formal operations stage*: ages 13+, can reason about novel situations, can think abtractly. 


## Language

- Chidlren may have an innate mental module for language. 
	- Deaf children invent sign languages that show similar senence structures to actual languages.
