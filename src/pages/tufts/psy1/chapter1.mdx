## The history of modern psychology

- Great thinkers in history (Aristotle, Zoroaster) raised “psychological” questions, but they answered them with anecdotes instead of evidence. 
- **Phrenology**, the pseudoscientific belief that bumps on the skull could tell us about a person’s personality traits, became popular in the 1800s. 
	- Example of anecdotal “psychology” not working. 
- In 1879, Wilhelm Wundt established the first psychological lab. 
	- Volunteers were trained to carefully observe and analyze their own sensations. 
	- Wundt is credited for initiating the movement to make psychology a science. 
- **Functionalism** emphasized the purpose of behavior, as opposed to its description. 
	- Ask how an action helps a person/animal adapt to the environment. 
- Freud was a physician who became convinced that depression, nervousness, etc came from childhood conflicts and traumas that were too threatening to be remembered consciously. 
	- For example, sexual feelings for a parent. 
	- Eventually his ideas evolved into a broad theory of personality and a method of psychotherapy, both known as **psychoanalysis**. 
	- Freud did not rigorously test his theories. 


## Major perspectives in psychology

### Biological

- Hormones
- Chemical imbalances
- Illness

**Evolutionary psychology**: how behavior that was useful in our evolutionary past may be reflected in our present behaviors, mental processes, and traits. 

### Learning

- How environments and experience affect humans and animals
- People learn by imitating others and by reacting to surrounding events

### Cognitive

- Focuses on what goes on inside people’s heads

### Sociocultural

- Focuses on social and cultural forces outside the individual
	- Perception of the world, expressing emotions, how we treat people


## What psychologists do

- **Psychotherapist**: does any kind of psychotherapy. Not legally regulated. 
- **Psychoanalyst**: practice one particular form of therapy — psychoanalysis. Requires degree and training. 
- **Psychiatrist**: a medical doctor who treats mental disorders. 


## Steps for critical thinking

1. Be willing to ask copious “why?” questions
2. Define your terms (“What makes people happy?” “What does _happy_ mean here?”)
3. Analyze your own assumptions and biases
4. Examine the available evidence (and reliability of that evidence)
5. Weigh the conclusions, generating as many reasonable interpretations of evidence as possible

At the end you arrive at a **theory**.
