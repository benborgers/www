How do media affect our thoughts, feelings, and actions? 

- Laugh tracks take advantage of **conformity** - altering behaviors/opinions to match those of others. 
	- Why?
		- You think that other people know the right answer (*informational* basis)
		- To fit in (*normative* basis)
- Study: watched debate with other people, some vocally pro-Democrat and others vocally pro-Republican. This affects people’s impressions of the debate. 
- Another study: on-screen line graphs favor Democrat or Republican. This also sways people’s opinions of the candidates’ performances. 
- Examples
	- Political attitudes
	- Marketing/advertising
- In a study that Facebook performed on their users, emotional content of your Facebook feed affected the emotional sentiment in what people posted. 


How accurate are media depictions of psychological issues? 

- **The best predictor for future behavior is past behavior.** 
- You need to account for initial behavior when trying to track down a change. 
- TV viewing and video game playing are far weaker predictors of attentional problems than *past attentional problems*.
