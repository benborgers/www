**Sensation** is awareness of our surroundings (sound, color, form). **Perception** is interpreting this. 

## Senses

- **Doctrine of specific nerve energies** says that we have different senses because different signals received by sense organs stimulate different nerve pathways and go to different places in the brain. 
- **Synesthesia** is a rare condition where people’s senses cross. Scientists have hypothesized that it’s a result of additional nerve connections. 
- **Absolute threshold**: the smallest change in a sense (vision, hearing) that you can detect. 
- **Selective attention**: the ability to focus on some parts of the environment and not others. 
	- We’re really good at not registering objects, to prevent sensory overload. 

## Vision

- Light has three dimensions: 
	- **Hue**: color, wavelength
	- **Brightness**
	- **Saturation**
- The front of the eye is protected by the *cornea*. Behind it sits a *lens*, which subtly changes its shape to focus. The amount of light allowed in is controlled by muscles in the *iris*, which surrounds the *pupil*. 
	- In the back of the eye, the *retina*, an extension of the brain (the tissue it’s formed from is from the brain). 
	- The more numerous receptors, *rods*, are sensitive to light. The other receptors, *cones*, are sensitive to color. 
		- Cones need lots lights, so color vision is worse in the dark. 
	- The optic nerve leaves the eye at the *optic disc*, where there are no rods or cones, which causes a blind spot. 
	- **Feature-detector cells** fire in response to specific features (horizontal lines, vertical lines, etc) to make up edges of objects. 
		- Others respond specifically to faces, hands, tools, words, numbers. 
	- Theories about vision:
		- **Trichromatic theory**: color perception comes from having separate cones that are sensitive to blue, green, and red. 
		- **Opponent-process theory**: cells fire for opposite colors (blue/yellow, red/green). 
			- The cells that switch on or off to signal “green” send the opposite signal (“red”) when green is removed. 
		- **Gestalt principles**:
			- Things closer together are grouped together (**Proximity**)
			- The brain fills in gaps to create complete forms (**Closure**)
			- Things that are alike are perceived as belonging together (**Similarity**)
			- Lines and patterns are perceived as continuing in time or space (**Continuity**)
		- Judging distances:
			- **Convergence**: judging how much your eyes turn inward to focus on something close by. 
			- **Retinal disparity**: how different the views from your two eyes are. 


## Hearing

- The **organ of Corti** is the actual organ of hearing, which contains *hair cells* which are receptors. 
	- The hair cells rise and fall with sound, brushing against another membrane. The hair cells bending initiates a signal that’s sent along the *auditory nerve*. 


## Taste

- **Papillae**: tiny bumps on your tongue, whose sides are lined with **taste buds**. 
	- Actual taste receptors are *inside* taste buds (50-150 per taste bud). 

## Pain

- **Gate-control theory**
	- Pain impulses must get past a (metaphorical) “gate” in the spinal cord. 
		- Gate = neural activity that blocks pain messages or lets them through
		- When body tissue is injured, large fibers and damaged and small fibers open the gate, and pain messages can reach the brain. 
		- Stimulation (ice pack, heat) can interfere with pain by closing the gate. 
	- **Phantom pain**: pain experienced from parts of the body that have been amputated. 
		- Theory: other neurons have invaded the neurons that correspond to the amputated body part, and they are sending signals. 
		- Showing an amputee a mirror that creates the illusion of two healthy limbs can resynchronize signals and has been very effective. 

## Internal senses

- **Kinesthesis** tells us where our body parts are. 
- **Equilibrium** is our sense of balance. 
	- Relies on **semicircular canals** in the inner ear.
