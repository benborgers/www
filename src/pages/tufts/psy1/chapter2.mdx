## Nervous System

- Central Nervous System: brain and spinal cord
	- Spine connects brain with body. 
	- Spinal cord also produces immediately responses (e.g. touching hot things). 
- Peripheral Nervous System: nerves that connect to nervous receptors, muscles, and glands
	- (Sensory nerves carry messages from skin and muscles to the spinal cord. Motor nerves carry orders from Central Nervous System to muscles and glands (which control hormones).)
	- Somatic Nervous System: muscles, skin
	- Autonomic Nervous System: involuntary actions (e.g. breathing)
		- Sympathetic System: emergency responses; hyping up
		- Parasympathetic system: non-emergency responses; calming


## Types of Cells

- Neurons are cells that transmit into the Central Nervous System
- Glia cells hold neurons in place, provide nutrients, and help neurons grow


## Neurons

| Neurons | Body (Soma) | Axon |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Receive messages | DNA | Communicates with neurons, muscles, and glands |
| Transmit messages to body | Growth and reproduction | Insulated by fatty **myelin sheath** (insulates against interferences, makes communication faster) | 

- **Stem cells** are a type of immature cell with the potential to be any type of cell (including new neurons)
- The spot where axons and dendrites meet is called the **synapse**
	- There’s a gap between the two called a **synaptic cleft**
- Neurons have negative charge inside. When stimulated, gates open which makes the charge more positive. If the charge becomes positive enough, an **action potential** is triggered (the neuron fires). 

## Studying the Brain

- **Lesion method**: figuring out what parts of the brain do by removing them in animals and seeing what happens
- **Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)**: using electrical currents to stimulate or suppress certain neural circuits. 
- **Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS)**: newer version of TMS. 
- **EEG**: “listens” to brain activity. 
- **ERP**: variant of EEG for measuring waves of electrical activity in response to stimuli. 
- **PET scan**: records biochemical changes in the brain. 
- **MRI**: gives a picture of the brain. 
- **fMRI**: shows brain activity related to specific thoughts or behaviors by detecting blood oxygen in regions.
