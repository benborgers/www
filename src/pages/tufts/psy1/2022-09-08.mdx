## What are the most effective ways to study?

![](https://share.cleanshot.com/87fbJr/download)

### Rereading

- Most studies are on massed rereading (back-to-back), which is easier to study, not spaced rereading.
  - This is low **ecological validity** (how real a study’s scenario is)

### Note-taking

- Laptop note-takers do more verbatim notes, handwritten can’t keep up so they don’t
- Laptop vs. handwritten were equal on factual recall
- Handwritten performs better on conceptual test
- Hand-writing notes seems to force active learning

### Outlining

- Teacher-generated outlines
  - Skeletal (incomplete) outlines better than complete outlines or transcripts
- Learner-generated outlines
  - Read through entire text, _then_ outline

### Flash cards

- This is called **retrieval practice**
- Recalling information helps consolidate it
- Don’t be “done” with a card until you get it right 3 times

## Listening to music while studying

- Listening to pop music hampers the ability to answer reading comprehension questions (Anderson & Fuller, 2010)
- Memory is best under silence, next is music without lyrics, worst is music with lyrics
- Music affects introverts more negatively than extroverts
