## Magnetic Fields

- Moving charges creates a magnetic field. 
- The magnetic north pole of the Earth is moving (and we don’t know why). 
- Magnetic poles flip every once in a while. 
	- We can tell by looking at fault lines and seeing which way metal slivers in rocks are pointing and how old these rocks are (further from fault line = older; at fault line = newly created rock). 
- Planets in The Big Chill phase (not geologically active anymore) have less of a magnetic field. 


### Aurora

- Aurora are charged particles from the sun interacting with our magnetic field. 
	- The lines in the image = the lines of our magnetic field


## Things hitting Earth

- Material is constantly hitting Earth (~30,000 tons/year)
- Asteroids hit Earth and have amino acids and organic materials. **These materials form in space.** 

## Stratigraphy

**Stratigraphy**: the idea that lower rocks are older. 

## Supercontinent

All continents used to be connected. 

### Evidence
- Rocks separated by big distances are exactly the same. 
- Fossils of animals that couldn’t have swam so far are found on multiple continents. 
- Coal found in Antarctica. 
	- Coal comes from forests and dead animals (carbon-rich). 
- Continental *shelf* fits together ~perfectly. 

### How?

Convection in the Earth makes tectonic plates “surf” and moved continents apart.
