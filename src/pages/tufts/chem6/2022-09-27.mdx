- The moon likely formed when a huge (~planet-size) world collided with Earth, and a chunk flew off. 
	- The moon’s materials match the composition and age of Earth’s except for those destroyed in great heat. 

## 5 Stages of Terrestrial Planetary Evolution 

(_terrestrial_ = a planet you can stand on)

1. Origin
2. Differentiation
	- Worlds become sphere
	- Denser things go towards the center
		- Earth has the Crust, Mantle (the majority), and Core (made of Iron)
			- Outer core is liquid, inner core is solid
		- We know what’s in Earth by measuring seismic waves during earthquakes
3. Late Heavy Bombardment
4. Geological Activity
5. The Big Chill
	- Fuel for volcanoes comes from nuclear fission (things breaking apart and releasing energy)
	- This fuel is used up over time, and the amount of fuel is correlated with its size. After it runs out, volcanic activity stops, and that’s **The Big Chill**. 


## Electricity = Magnetism

- Earth’s magnetic field comes from moving molten rock inside of it.
	- It creates a shield for Earth against damaging particles from solar winds.
