I really enjoyed the last class that looked forward. We often hear the idea that “eventually the Earth will be subsumed by the sun,” but I didn’t know that photosynthesis will end much sooner, and that land life will cease to exist, and then the outer core will freeze. All this will happen much before the sun becomes a red giant and envelops the Earth. 

It all sounds a bit scary, except for no good reason — it’s all happening in at least hundreds of millions of years, when humans have only existed for single digit millions of years.
