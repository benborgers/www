- The sun was 30% dimmer when life began, but this has had very little effect on Earth’s temperature. 
	- Why has Earth’s temperature not changed as the sun heated? 
		- The Earth used to have way more CO2. 
		- As time went on, CO2 was depleted by erosion (weathering/erosion includes a chemical reaction that removes CO2), and later by life (plants) on Earth. 
		- The two factors have roughly balanced each other out. 
- We can measure ancient temperatures using isotope ratios in rock samples. 
	- Lighter isotopes move more when it’s hotter and therefore are less present in rocks/ice. 
- Pavement gets heated up, then the UV light it emits can’t escape due to the greenhouse effect. 
- CO2 is not the most powerful greenhouse gas - H2O is. 
	- But, small changes to CO2 levels in atmosphere make dramatic changes to Earth’s temperature. 
- Until recently, CO2 in the atmosphere has been in decline. 
- Earth has very little CO2 because it’s pulled from the atmosphere (weathering/erosion). 
- Having life on a planet regulates CO2 levels. 
- Continent placement affects climate. 
	- If there’s more ice surface area, more sunlight is reflected back out. 
- Earth has gone through periodic swings in CO2 levels. 
	- But our current levels are *very much not in normal ranges*. 
	- These swings are due to Milankovic Cycles. 
		- Eccentricity (orbit is circle or ellipse)
		- Obliquity (axis tilt)
		- Precession (top of Earth spins like a top)
