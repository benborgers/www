## The Central Dogma

```
DNA → RNA (multiple types) → Proteins
 (transcription)         (translation)
```

### Transcription

DNA → mRNA transcript

### Translation

mRNA → Protein

- tRNA match to mRNA in chunks of 3 nucleotides. 
	- Ribosomal RNA holds mRNA still so tRNA can find its match. 
- RNA maps to amino acids - multiple RNA chunks per amino acid, to be tolerant to possible mutations. 
- Amino acids link together via peptide onds. 


### Protein Structures

1. Primary structure - amino acid chain (polypeptide)
2. Secondary structure - folded structure within a polypeptide
3. Tertiary structure - 3D structure of polypeptide
4. Quartenary structure - multiple polypeptide chains joining together to make a protein
When proteins are denatured, they go from quartenary structures to tertiary structures. 

### Vaccines

**Traditional vaccines**: have a bit of the virus (live or killed). 
- Example: smallpox is a live virus
- We don’t use live virus much anymore


**mRNA Vaccine for Covid**: Injects mRNA transcript of Covid spike proteins. 
- Cells express it into a protein, immune system mounts a response. 
- Why mRNA vaccine for Covid?
	- Covid mutates/evolves very fast, so it’s hard to pin down one version to include in the vaccine. 
	- Even a weakened version of the virus could be dangerous to immunocompromised people. 
	- Because it’s a coronavirus, future mutations should also have the spike protein.
