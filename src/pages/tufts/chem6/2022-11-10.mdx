- Object: meteoroid. Fire trail: meteor. On Earth’s surface: meteorite. 
- Asteroids are large and orbit the sun, meteoroids are much smaller and orbit the sun. 


- Some meteorites arrive on Earth with water, organic materials, and amino acids. 
- There are 200 impact crators on Earth. 
- 70% of all creatures (including the dinosaurs) suddenly went extinct 66 million years ago. 
- Every 100 million years we come close to another star, and are in the “oort cloud” of that star’s orbiting meteoroids.
	- This also coincides with the times when we have large impacts. 
- Asteroid that killed the dinosaurs (66 million years ago)
	- Rocks look different above and below KT boundary between ages. 
	- If you test the chalky middle layer in rocks, it’s rich in Iridium (rare material on Earth). 
	- Shocked quartz - similar to what i sfound around bomb sites - was found more in samples near Haiti/USA, which indicates that the event was in the Southeastern USA. 
	- Crator found (Chixalub Crator)
		- 200 km wide crator
	- World was dark and cold for 3 years after impact
	- Huge biological diversity *after* these events, since evolution moves quickly to fill in the now-empty niches
- Will an asteroid like this happen again? 
	- Certainly yes. 
	- Events like KT (that killed the dinosaurs) happen every 100 million years, and that one happened 66 million years ago...
