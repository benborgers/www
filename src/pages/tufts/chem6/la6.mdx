I thought the part about why the Covid vaccine is an mRNA vaccine was really interesting! I didn’t know that it was because Covid mutates so quickly that it would be difficult to isolate a live vaccine. It’s really cool how the mRNA that the vaccine injects ties into the Central Dogma that we learned this week. 

I actually got my Covid booster today, so I was thinking about how the Covid spike proteins were injected and how my immune system will fight back at those spike proteins — hopefully not fighting back too strongly, or else I’ll be out of commission for the weekend.
