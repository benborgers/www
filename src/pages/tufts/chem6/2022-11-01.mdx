- A layer of water sublimes on top of tectonic plates, making it easier to melt the rock, which helps volcanoes. 
- **Primary Atmosphere**: made up of mostly hydrogen and helium. 
- **Secondary Atmosphere**: gasses added to atmosphere (outgassing or evaporation) and removed from atmosphere through atmospheric sinks (condensation, chemical reactions with surface materials, and **thermal escape**). 

## Thermal Escape

- Graph shows speed of molecules moving (due to their temperature) and escape velocity (proxy for gravity). 
- Gasses are either heated up a lot and fly off, or the escape velocity is so low that even cold particles can fly off,. 
- **How to read the graph: a planet can hold on to gasses below it on the graph.** 


To hold on to gasses better: 
1. Colder planet (so gas particles move less)
2. More gravity (to hold on to gas particles)


- World atmosphere depends on distance from sun, and gravity. 
- Venus probably had a similar atmosphere to Earth, but greenhouse effect made it very hot and water boiled off.


## Measuring spectrum though subtraction
 
- You can take a spectrum of a planet as it passes in front of a star, subtract the star, and get the planetâ€™s spectrum.
