- Rainbows are formed when light goes through water droplets and bends at different angles. 
- The sun’s atmosphere has elements that absorb specific wavelengths. 
	- If you look at a star and see a gap in the wavelengths, you know what elements it has. 
- **Redshift** is when something going away from you shifts towards the red end of the spectrum. **Blueshift** is when something coming towards you shifts towards blue. 
- **”Standard candles”** allow us to measure changes in brightness of distant stars, and figure out how far away they are. 

## The Big Bang

- Hubble discovered that things further away are moving faster away from us. 
	- From this, he concluded: _The Universe is expanding unformly._
	- When things expand uniformly, further things move away at higher rates. 
	- If you reverse this process, everything goes back to one point that contains _everything_. At the very beginning, it was just energy (the Big Bang). 

### First 3 minutes of the Big Bang

Protons and neutrons smashed together, forming hydrogen and helium. 

- The vast majority of all helium in existence today was made during this time.
