- Neanderthals
	- Evidence of some helping others
	- Feathers were worn - it could have signified status or origin? 
	- Evidence of musical instruments
	- Invented a type of glue
- Homo Sapiens and Neanderthals interbred with each other
	- Theories:
		- Population replacement
			- Proposes that anatomically modern human beings evolved from a premodern humans in one geographical area
		- Multiregional
			- Suggests there were a number of different populations within this species that formed different branches and some populations even became extinct along the way
			- Most supported by the data
		- Middle Ground
			- Africa was the source of modern humans, but no complete population replacement
- Earliest modern _Homo sapiens_ and transitional fossils found in Africa
- Most people today have 1-4% Neanderthal DNA
	- Most prevalent in Europe, specifically Italy
	- Not much in Africa since Neanderthals weren’t there
- Upper Paleolithic
	- 50,000 years ago
	- Broadening of the subsistence base (better use of environment) - small mammal trapping, fishing, different plant species
	- New uses for plant materials
	- New tool technologies, elaborate cave paintings
- Early Americans
- How did humans get to the Americas?
	- People came across “ice-free corridor” through Alaska
	- Also it could be that people to maritime routes, but that’s hard to investigate because those sites are underwater
		- People like to hug the coast as they move because there’s resources
- Clovis points = a technology for sharp tools
- Majority of modern Native Americans derive their ancestry from a population that arrived more than 15,000 years ago
	- Supported by linguistic data
- NAGPRA: Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act
	- Dictates how Native American remains and significant objects are to be dealt with, permissions around that, and how they should be returned to Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations
