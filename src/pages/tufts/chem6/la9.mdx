I enjoyed the class about climate change, and I think that framing it in terms of “why are people who deny climate change both right and wrong?” was a good framing. It made the class relevant to something that people might’ve been wondering about already, or at least it’s a compelling enough question such that people want to know the answer. 

It was really interesting to me to learn that the increase in the sun’s brightness and the decrease of CO2 levels in the atmosphere (due to life on Earth) have balanced each other out. 

The graph of CO2 levels that went way further back was also super informative. I didn’t realize _how much_ out of the norm current levels are, despite normal fluctuations. That graph by itself is super convincing.
