## 3 Origin of Life Hypotheses

### Primordial Soup

- In a hot aqueous environment, we had everything we needed for life. 
	- Electrical activity as well. 
- Miller-Urey Experiment (1953)
	- “Recreated” early Earth environment
	- Replicated heat and lightning
	- Condensed mixture and found amino acids, precursors for nucleo bases, etc
- These results were *not replicable*
- The “pre-life conditions” were not accurate
	- Atmosphere could not have held on to hydrogen
	- Methane was not there, it mostly comes from life

### Meteorite Hypothesis

- Meteorites bombard Earth, materials landed on Earth that way. 

#### Interstellar Clouds

- Miller-Urey did actually recreate interstellar clouds, showing that interstellar clouds can create biological molecules. 
- Meteorites could get biological molecules from interstellar clouds

### The Combination Hypothesis

- Key compounds created in interstellar clouds → meteorites → rain down on Earth → Earth’s conditions allowed it to progress into larger organic molecules


## Chirality

- Thalidomide was a drug given to pregnant women to help with morning sickness. The half of the drug with inaccessible chirality caused problems with fetal limb development. 


## Key unanswered questions by origin of life hypotheses

- How does DNA and RNA self-replicate? 
- How do we make a full nucleic acid? 
	- We’ve got the parts, but not how they get put together. 
- Humans are homochiral (only have one chirality) and no theory for the origin of life fully accounts for homochirality. 
	- Last common ancestor had homochirality.
