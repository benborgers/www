- **DNA** has a double helix shape, with bas pairs (A, T, C, G) joined by hydrogen bonds. 
- **RNA** is single stranded
	- Can form a double helix by itself, but usually doesn’t. 
- 3 main parts of DNA and RNA:
	- phosphate linking group
	- nucleic acid base → reflects changes of A/T/C/G
	- sugar group
- Differences between DNA and RNA:
	- RNA uses Uracil instead of Thymine
		- They’re chemically very similar
	- DNA has H at 2’, RNA has OH at 2’
- Nucleotides link via a condensation reaction (produces H2O) between phosphate and sugar (**sugar-phosphate backbone**). 
- Why do we have both DNA and RNA?
	- DNA is much more stable.
	- Lack of oxygen in DNA makes it energy intensive to replicate. 
		- But DNA can still self-replicate. 
- **RNA World hypothesis**: all genetic information was once stored in RNA. 
	- Start simple and evolve to be more complex. 
	- This was during pre-cellular times.
