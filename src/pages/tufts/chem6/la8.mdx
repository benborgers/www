I thought that learning about the combination hypothesis, including biological molecule formation in interstellar clouds, was really interesting.

I had only learned about the primordial soup theory in high school, even though I feel like my AP Bio class was quite good and up-to-date. I wonder why we didn’t learn about other theories in high school if the Miller-Urey experiment was refuted so strongly, and I was in high school after creationism seems to have already subsided. 

I wonder whether they’re now teaching the meteorite hypothesis and combination hypothesis in that AP Bio class in my high school, or whether the textbook still only references primordial soup and therefore they’re only teaching that.
