- We’re currently in a “golden age” of exoplanet studies, and have confirmed 5,000 exoplanets so far. 
- The sun is not at the center of the solar system. 
	- The sun wobbles a bit due to the orbit of the planets. 
	- We can measure this movement using spectroscopy. 
	- Imagine a seesaw — the more massive object is closer to the center of the seesaw, but it’s still rotating a bit. 
- Radial velocity method for finding exoplanets. 
	- Using the seesaw method to observe the sun moving with the doppler effect. 
- “Transit” method for finding exoplanets
	- If a planet passes in front of the face of a star, the brightness of the star drops. 
	- The alignment has to be perfect. 
- Kepler telescope showed that planets are common around stars. 
	- Previously, this was theorized but not confirmed. 
	- 3-4 planets per star. 
- Direct imaging method for finding exoplanet. 
	- Block out light from the star.
