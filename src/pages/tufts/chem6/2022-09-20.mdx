- Around massive objects, Newton’s theory of gravity isn’t right. 
	- Massive objects bend 3D space, so nearby objects bend into a 4th dimension: time. 
- Stars form from gas clouds being collapsed by gravity. 
	- Stars of all different sizes and hotness are created. 
- Spectral Types: OBAFGKMLTY (TY = failed stars)
	- Only Boring Astronomers Find Gratification Knowing Mnemonics Like This — Yeah! 
	- Stars in same spectral type have same spectra. 
- Most stars are along the main sequence: dim and cold and small to bright and hot and big. 
- Sun spots are spots where the electrical field is stronger and the sun can’t convect. 
	- Gas comes up and doesn’t go back down and cools. 
- **Nuclear fusion**: the sun takes protons, smashes them together, and ends up with helium. 
	- 4 protons → helium and light
		- Protons must be heated to 10 million Kelvin to be smashed together
			- Therefore stars must be at least 10 million Kelvin
			- Nuclear fusion *defines* a star on the main sequence
			- Eventually stars run out of hydrogen
				- Big bright stars burn out fast
					- Big stars: 100,000 - 1,000,000 years
					- Our sun: 10-12 billion years
					- Smallest stars: trillions of years
- Stars don’t collapse because of pressure outwards from energy. 
	- When it runs out of hydrogen, it collapses, then gets really hot because it’s small, then expands to a red giant
- Red giant (in center) is now hot enough to fuze 3 heliums to get a carbon. 
	- You can keep fuzing to get other elements. 
- If the star is 8x the mass of the sun, it collapses and explodes, creating a **supernova**. 
	- This is how we got all of our current elements — they exploded into space via a supernova
- What’s left is a “neutron star”, which is the mass of the sun but the size of a city. 
- If the star is 25x the sun’s mass, it becomes a black hole (has mass but no size).
