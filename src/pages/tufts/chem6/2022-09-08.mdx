- Time is related to distance. 
	- Light takes time to get to us (at the speed of light). 
	- Everything we study in Astronomy is in the past. 
- 1.0 AU = 1 Astronomical Unit = average distance from Earth to Sun
	- ~93 million miles
	- ~8 light minutes
		- The distance light moves in 8 minutes
- Another unit: 1 parsec (pc) = 3.3 light years
- Our nearest star, Proxima Centauri, is 4.2 light years away. 
	- Most stars are 100-1,000 light years away. 
- Milky Way galaxy
	- Shaped like a frisbee
	- 75,000 light years across
- Our nearest large galaxy is Andromeda
	- 2.5 million light years away
- Solar System began forming **4.567 billion years ago**
- The universe is **13.8 billion years old**
	- But the universe is ~45 billion light years wide (how is that possible? weâ€™ll learn later)


## Light
- Short wavelength and high energy = blue
- Long wavelength and low energy = red
- Anything with temperature gives off light
