I thought it was really interesting to learn that all elements that we have access to formed in stars by other elements fuzing, and then exploded to where we are now via a supernova. 

I guess I always thought of elements as originating from _Earth_, but of course Earth itself originated from things in the universe, it didn’t just create itself. But it’s still hard to wrap your head around the fact that everything we do and experience is backed by materials that were created in space and then coalesced to create the Earth. It also brings up worries about what will happen when we run out of certain elements — we’ll probably have a lot of difficulty replenishing them to the level that they naturally appeared before we started using them up.
