## Prehistoric Diet

- Pollen analysis
- Wear patterns on teeth
- Types of tools used - hunting, plant processing
- Malnutrition - tooth decay
- Residue analysis
- Middens (trash)
- Cavities are generally not seen before the development of agriculture


## Trade

Trade between sites can be analyzed via minerals are soil at different sites. 


## Dating Archeological Materials

- Relative vs. absolute dating
	- Relative dating: stratigraphy
	- Absolute dating: radiometric dating (Carbon-14, Potassium/Argon)
		- Potassium/Argon: Dating Potassium distributed in crustal / volcanic sediments (rocks only)
	- Dendrochronology (tree rings)
- Direct vs. indirect (date vs. date associated materials)


## Evidence for Human Evolution

- What makes us human? 
	- Bipedalism
- What causes evolution? 
	- Mutations
	- Gene Flow
	- Natural Selection
	- Genetic Drift
		- Isolated population → different genetics
- **Hominids**: bipeds
- **Hominin**: humans, chimps, orangutans, gorillas
- Lots of early fossils found in Rift Valley in Africa
	- Tectonic plates, so early layers get exposed
- **Touma**:
	- Earliest fond biped, 6-7 million years ago
	- Found just cranium, but they can see where the spine connects so it’s a biped
