- **Gene**: the basic unit of heredity, at a specific location on a chromosome. 
	- Codes for a protein or a segment of a protein. 
- DNA is very compact. 
	- DNA wraps around **histone proteins**. 
	- Histones pack on top of themselves to form **chromatin**. 
	- Chromatin coils to make **chromosomes**. 
- Y chromosome is much smaller than X chromosome and takes less energy to replicate, so we see more males born during times of hardship (like the early Covid pandemic). 

## Cell Cycle

- Checkpoints between phases of cell cycle. 
	- G0 (rest) → (is environment favorable?) → S → G2 (is all DNA accurately replicated? is environment favorable?) → Mitosis → (are all chromosomes attached to spindles) → anaphase, cytokinesis
	- If checkpoints fail: apoptosis

## Tumors

Tumors happen when: 

1. Too much cell division, normal apoptosis. 
2. Normal cell division, not enough apoptosis.
