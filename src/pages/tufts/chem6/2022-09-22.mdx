- The stars that create elements are off the main sequence (the ones on the main sequence are making helium). 
- A galaxy with blue stars is actively forming new stars, because theyâ€™re hotter and newer. 
- Oxygen is the most abundant element in the Earth. 
- How planets form: 
	- A supernova forms lots of cloud and dust
	- Planets pick up mass like a snowball
	- Solar winds (of gasses) blow away other dust
- The solar system is 74% hydrogen, 24% helium, and 2% everything else. 
- Densities of common objects: 
	- Iron: 7.9 g/cm^3
	- Water: 1 g/cm^3
	- Ice: 0.9 g/cm^3
	- Rocks: ~3 g/cm^3
- **Terrestrial worlds**:worlds we can stand on (like the 4 inner planets). 
- **Frost line**: 3 AU
	- Inside the frost line, planets form out of only rock and iron (water vaporizes)
	- Outside the frost line, planets form out of rock, iron, and ice
- Denser things vaporize and condense at higher temperatures
