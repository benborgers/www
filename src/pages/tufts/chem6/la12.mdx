I thought it was really cool how these couple classes set a few misconceptions I had about early humans straight. For example, I definitely had this impression that Neanderthals were a brutish and “primitive” species, so it was surprising to me that they developed art and rituals, specifically rituals around burying their dead. 

I also previously had the impression that _Homo sapiens_ “beat” Neanderthals with some sort of superior intelligence, so the multiregional hypothesis was really interesting. But the evidence shown in class, like transitional fossils that’ve been discovered, makes the multiregional hypothesis make a lot of sense.
