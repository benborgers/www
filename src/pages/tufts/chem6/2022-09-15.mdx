- The full moon in September is called the “Harvest Moon”, but it’s just a regular full moon (in September). 
- The moon closer to the horizon looks red because there’s more atmosphere you’re looking through, and red light isn’t as scattered by it. 
- **Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation**: microwave light in all directions that’s left over from the Big Bang. 
	- Evidence for the Big Bang — the theory predicts this radiation, and they found it. 
- The data support not only an expanding universe, but also _accelerated_ expansion of the universe. 
- The universe is expanding at a rate greater than the speed of light. 
- You would predict that the center of galaxies should rotate much faster than the edges. But that’s not what’s observed. So we explain that with **dark matter** — there’s 10x more mass than we can observe. 
- Galaxies are expanding from each other, but **stars and planets aren’t** (the scale is too small). 
- Galaxies start as discs because they collapse and then spin out. 
	- Other shapes (like footballs) are formed from merging galaxies.
