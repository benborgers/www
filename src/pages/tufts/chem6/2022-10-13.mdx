## Cellular Respiration

Glucose → Energy

C6H12O6 + 6O2 → 6CO2 + 6H2O + ATP (energy, stored in chemical bonds)

### Steps

1. Glycolysis
2. Krebs / Citric Acid Cycle
3. Electron Transport Chain


**Glycolysis** (splitting sugar) yields 2 ATP and *doesn’t require oxygen* (so it’s good during extreme exercise). 

**Glycolysis + Krebs Cycle** yields 36 ATP. 

## Photosynthesis

6H2O + 6CO2 + nutrients/sunlight → C6H12O6 + 6O2. 

### Steps:

1. Light-dependent reactions (light + H2O → NADPH + ATP)
2. The Calvin Cycle (CO2 → G3P; G3P eventually becomes glucose somehow)
	- Happens during the night, because daytime should be used for light-dependent reactions.
