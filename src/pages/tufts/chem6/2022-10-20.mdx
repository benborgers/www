## Meiosis

**Meiosis**: formation of haploid gametic cells. 

- Cells have half the DNA, so when combined with another cell in fertilization thereâ€™s the normal number of chromosomes. 
- Similar to mitosis, twice, with any DNA replication the first time. 
	- **Crossing over** of chromosomes mixes them to create genetic diversity. 


## Stem Cell

Can turn into any other cell. 

## Mutations

- Mutations during cell division are seen in the organism itself. 
- Mutations during meiosis are express in its children. 

## Heterozygote advantage

`Aa` has an advantage over `AA` *and* `aa` (example: immunity against malaria / sickle cell).
