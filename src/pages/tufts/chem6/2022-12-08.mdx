- In ~250 million years, tectonic plates will combine to create a new supercontinent.
- Sun is getting hotter every day. 
	- Right now, that doesn’t have an effect on climate, but eventually it will. 
	- More storms, more chemical weathering. 
- Photosynthesis ends in 500-800 million years
	- Not enough CO2
- Land life ends 800 million to 1 billion years from now. 
	- Plants can no longer photosynthesize. 
	- Huge amounts of water evaporates. 
- Oceans evaporate (1-2 billion years). 
- Outer core freezes, “the big chill” (2 billion years). 
	- Materials in Earth that keep the core moving will run out. 
	- No more magnetic field. 
		- Earth will be subject to the sun’s wind. 
- Red giant sun, sun envelops the Earth (5-7 billion years)
- There is evidence of liquid water on Jupiter and Saturn’s moons. 
	- The tidal pull of gravity heats up these moons, which should usually be frozen.
