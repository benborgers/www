**The Importance of Carbon**

- Carbon is found in:
	- DNA
	- Proteins
	- Carbohydrates
	- Lipids
- **Valence electrons**: electrons in the outermost shell
	- Participate in bonding
- **Ionization energy** decreases with atomic size - further from the pull of the nucleus
- Types of bonds
	- **Ionic bonds**: one molecule just takes the electron from another molecule
		- Like NaCl
		- Magnetic based attraction
	- **Covalent bonds**: electron is shared and orbiting around 2 nuclei
		- Hydrogen forms covalent bonds because it doesn’t give away its only electron
		- Single, double, and triple covalent bonds exist
	- **Polar covalent bond**: covalent bond but electron is not equally shared
		- Common with Hydrogen
		- Causes partial negative charge / partial positive charge
- Silicon seems like a similar backbone as Carbon, but when it interacts with water it becomes sand
	- Also it’s too heavy to be a backbone
	- However, there are planets where lakes are hydrocarbon liquid (gas), where silicon could be the backbone of life
- None of the organic elements have the versatility (4 valence electrons) that Carbon does
- **Chirality**
	- When carbon forms 4 separate bonds, it makes a tetrahedral shape
	- Chiral molecules are almost identical, but not because they’re mirror images, and they behave slightly differently
	- They are in tons of key biological molecules
	- Structures are “right handed” and “left handed”
		- DNA is all right handed
		- Proteins and other structures only work on one chirality because it depends on how it fits into the structure
