- A bunch of raw cotton started being available (slavery). 
- They shipped it to Manchester, England, where it was spun into cloth in factories. 
- Fredrick Engels wrote a book about how this wasn’t good for workers, and worked with Marx on the _Communist Manifesto_. 
- Engels realizes that women spinning and that cloth immediately becoming the property of factory owners, is kinda like women spinning at home and that cloth immediately belonging to their husband/father (women couldn’t own anything). 
	- All the money that women earned in factories went straight to room and board. 
- People started thinking about who’s doing the working and who’s benefitting from the work. 
- In spinning Grimm fairy tales, you can hear two voices: women being like this is hard work, and Wilhelm being like industriousness is good and it can’t be that hard.
