## _Gender Trouble_, Judith Butler

- How we represent women using a language that oppresses women? 
- There isn’t necessarily a thing in the world that’s exactly “woman”. 
	- We *produce* what we pretend to *represent*. 
- Butler: maybe we should just get rid of this essentialist idea of “woman”. 
- These is a cultural norm and alignment between sex, gender, and desire. (cis het normativity, and a sex & gender binary)
	- When things don’t follow this, society “skips a beat”
	- But we don’t realize that these things are made up by society, just because they feel like they’ve always been this way doesn’t mean they’re natural and real
- Butler: The thing being oppressed is a series of cultural actions that goes by the name of “woman”. To be a woman is to act feminine, it’s a continuous doing of womanhood. 
	- To be a women is a continuous act of things that are culturally coded as feminine. 
		- Because people are always judging a person’s expression of gender.
