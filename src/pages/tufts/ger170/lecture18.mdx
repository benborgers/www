## Ideology

Professor Peltcher is writing a book on this! 

- We have ideas that are “material.” Ideology is not just ideas inside a head, it’s actions, bureaucratic systems, city zoning, etc out in the real world. 
	- Not thoughts and ideals, it’s how thoughts and ideals are manifested in the real world. 
	- It doesn’t matter whether people *think* they have these ideologies or not. 
	- There is no “doer” behind the deed, there’s a series of interconnected deeds, and behind those deeds the material actions in the material world are what’s important. 
		- This is how ideologies spread. 
- We don’t know whether Wilhelm Grimm was misogynist in his brain. But we can make an argument that his *actions* are misogynist. 
	- You can’t say what kind of person someone *is*, but you can say what they *do* in the world. 
- Often we think think these actions are natural or self-evident. 
	- It’s the stuff that’s assumed for a power dynamic to take hold. 
- Connections to fairy tales
	- “Of course women spin in the home”
	- “Of course the black bride is ugly and white bride is beautiful, that’s just the way it is”
	- Beauty is a social construct, but in _Snow White_ it’s presented as objective. 
- Example: some people crush every hand that they shake in the real world, and that repeats and reproduces a particular dynamic of power (one that values physical strength, manliness, big-handedness, etc). 

Ideology isn’t a value judgement. Homophobia is as much an ideology as queer liberation. Ideology is a way to examine things that are usually overlooked, because they just *seem* right.

## Enlightenment

- Adorno and Horkheimer in 1944 (additional context: they were Jews in exile): why has the Enlightenment not fixed the world? Why didn’t it deliver on its promise? 
- You need a borgia education and German+French language and access to someone who’s a publisher. 
- Enlightenment forces us to alienate parts of ourselves in search of rationality, and nature. 
- We’ve given rationality so much power over us, so we feel like it’s the only way to face our problems. 
	- “If you’re a hammer, every problem looks like a nail”
- Rationality: 
	- “It’s not a good night’s sleep, it’s a good sleep score on your phone”
	- “It’s not a nice walk, it’s 10,000 steps”
	- “It’s not a pretty star, it’s JR-1412”
	- “They’re not people with real hopes and feelings, they’re Covid fatality numbers / voting blocs / etc”
- Rationality turns everything into numbers and data such that it becomes mythological again. 
	- All we’ve gained through the Enlightenment is data. 
	- “We know them only in so far as we can manipulate/master them.”
	- ★ People used to create myths to explain things. We create data-driven quantitative analysis to explain things.  


## Dialectics

**Dialectics:** a system has within it, its own opposite or the potential for its own opposite. 

- Example: “The master needs a slave to be a slave. The slave has the power to determine whether they’re a master or not.”
- Capitalism has, in itself, the ability to turn back into feudalism if it keeps running. 
- ★ If we let the Enlightenment run wild, rationalization and reason will estrange us from ourselves and the real natural world to such a degree that we’ll eventually revert back to mythological thinking. 
	- We only know something to the degree that we can control it. 
	- But this is exactly what Enlightenment thought was supposed to be better than.
