## Periods

- Very old
- Enlightenment
	- Let’s think for ourselves instead of having people think for us.
	- Conversation in the community is good.
	- King should be nice to us.
- Romanticism
	- Hold on all this Enlightenment stuff is going *way too fast*. 
	- Let’s just *feel* and be dark and brooding the Black Forest. 
- Realism
	- Let’s get real, Romanticists! 
	- Lower and middle-class peoples’ lives aren’t great but we’ll still write about it poetically.
