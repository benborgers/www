## Why are the Grimms so into fairy tales?

- The overwhelming desire for a unified Germany.
  - The Grimms thought the 300 principalities in Germany were such a mess.
  - The Grimms lived in the West, where France kept invading, and people were worried about losing their culture.
- The bourgeois: a new dominant cultural force that decides what “educated” and “cultured” means.
- The Grimms were _nationalist_, but not in the way that we think of.
  - They’re still friends of democracy.
  - They saw themselves as patriots working towards a shared nation.
- And it worked! ![](https://share.cleanshot.com/7GBghU/download)
- The Grimms appropriated peasant culture and made it bourgeois.
  - All the principalities could point to this and be like, “yeah, that’s us, I’ve heard that story too!”.
- _The book of fairy tales made Germany as much as anything else._
  - The idea of Germany and this book are so tied together.

## Post-WWII

How did West Germany and East Germany contaminate the Grimms’ tales to help their needs?

- At first, West Germany didn’t change things very much. _War bad, bourgeois good, capitalism good, don’t rock the boat, upward mobility, everybody can get a job, strong middle class._
  - Everything’s great, ignore the Nazi stuff, happy ending.
    - The Grimms’ tales become very popular!
- In the 1950s and 1960s, hippies start asking questions like, “Why is it okay that all these adults were Nazis?”.
  - New ways to read fairy tales: maybe things are complex, and things aren’t always happily ever after.
    - Reframing
  - New types of tales in West Germany around this time: ![](https://share.cleanshot.com/hcgE2B/download)
- East Germany played up the working-class parts of the fairy tales and toppling of aristocracy, and got rid of money, revenge, racism, etc.
  - A lot of this was done with film, not writing.
