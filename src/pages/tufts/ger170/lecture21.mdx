## Why are the Grimms so into fairy tales?

- The overwhelming desire for a unified Germany.
	- The Grimms thought the 300 principalities in Germany were such a mess. 
	- The Grimms lived in the West, where France kept invading, and people were worried about losing their culture.  
- The bourgeois: a new dominant cultural force that decides what “educated” and “cultured” means. 
- The Grimms were *nationalist*, but not in the way that we think of. 
	- They’re still friends of democracy. 
	- They saw themselves as patriots working towards a shared nation. 
- And it worked! ![](https://share.cleanshot.com/7GBghU/download)
