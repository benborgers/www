## Grimms’ tales evolved over time

- Originally, the Grimms wrote their book as a faithful collection of German literature. 
	- They said that it was stories that parents could *pick from* and *retell*. 
- However, parents who bought it for children to read were horrified by its contents, so Wilhelm toned the language down significantly in subsequent editions, sometimes behind Jacob’s back. 
- Eventually the book morphed into something that was intended for children (as an *Erziehungsbuch*, or a book for children to learn manners from), with parents as a secondary audience. 

## Childhood Trauma

- The 1700s and 1800s were horrible for children. These stories of childhood trauma did actually happen to children. 
- Jack Zipes says: Why haven’t more people worked through the psychological effects of these tales? 
	- Psychologists ignore historical facts, and people who know history don’t know much about psychology. 


## The Girl With No Hands

- Girl has Electra Complex, but the idea of being with her father scares her terrible. 
	- Scared of the abuse and incest
- Girl punishes herself “back to infancy” by cutting off her hands.
