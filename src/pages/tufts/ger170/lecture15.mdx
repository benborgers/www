# Rumpelstiltskin

- What can the names that are guessed for Rumpelstiltskin tell us about motherhood? (They’re guesses by a mother.)
	- All these names were invented by Wilhelm, so it’s kinda a peak into what Wilhelm thinks motherhood should be.
	- The themes of the names (included by Wilhelm): women are particularly well-suited as wives and mothers, because they care about human life more than political power, etc. 
- Wilhelm edits the story to make a man (Rumpelstiltskin) do some spinning (how strange! for the time, at least). 
	- If a man can spin better than a woman, all that women are left to be is a bearer of life.
- Is Rumpelstiltskin a microbe or a virus? 
	- Terrorizing the mother and baby. 
	- Being able to name it is a way to start to treat it. 


## Spinning

- Spinning is a bummer, so society made it “women’s work.”
- Then, in Britain, spinning moved to factories. This just industrialized how bad it was, and moved the work to women _and_ younger children. 
	- Children developed deformaties and could no longer spin after they passed their “productive prime.”
		- Mostly hip and lower spine deformaties. People had to hunch over. 
- The Grimm brothers were kinda fans of spinning as a metaphor for industriousness. 
	- The women (who told the Grimms these stories) were not a fan. 
		- So there are two voices in a lot of these stories.
