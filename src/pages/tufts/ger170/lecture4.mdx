## René Descartes

- Applied scientific method to past philosophers, inventing “Rationalist Philosophy”
- Credited with creating modern philosophy
- Greatly influenced all the famous philosophers

## Enlightenment

- Reason, logic, rationality are primary sources of knowledge
  - Not dogma, magic, etc
- To gain knowledge follows the scientific method
- No more orthodoxy / blind tradition

- Germans did rational philosophy on rational philosophy
  - Trying to figure out what the enlightenment really is

## Immanuel Kant

- Enlightenment is “humanity’s emergence from self-imposed immaturity” (_immaturity_ = not thinking for themselves)
- Having people think for you is nice and convenient, but not enlightened

## Overall! on Enlightenment

- This is a new way to create knowledge
- Blind tradition and faith are out; scientific method is in
- Needs community to double check (this is not _personal_ enlightenment, like sitting in a cave and thinking real hard)
- Freedom for public scholars
- Obedience for private workers
