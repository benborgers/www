## The Romantics

- The Romantics thought the Enlightenment was dumb
  - 1790s - 1830s
  - But the Enlightenment was definitely winning
  - “weltschmerz”: things feel weird now, the old days were slower and simpler
- **Tales have no pretty bowtie, the reader and author just ends with a feeling of confusion**
- For Romantics, Black Forest (and forests in general) are places “untouched” by society
  - A more connected and centered connection with the world
  - Away from society’s pressures

## Eckbert the Blonde

- Based on true stories
