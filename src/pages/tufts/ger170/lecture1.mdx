## Critical Reading

- How does the text interact with what we know? With itself? Its history? Its contexts?

## Vocabulary

### Legend

- Mix of story and fact.
- Often spicing up a historical fact.
- Usually about someone high up on the social ladder (saint, king, etc).

### Fable

- Has a moral!
- Involves talking animals/plants.

### Myths

- Explain how something came to be.
- Marvel’s Infinity saga is an example.

### Folktales

- Passed through generations orally.
- Often about the specific place where it’s told.
- For example: ghost stories.

### Fairy tales

- Magical elements.
- Mashup of the other forms.
- Always: a problem introduced, a problem solved.

### Institutionalization

- When a fairy tale is codified from oral to written form.
- This can happen many times through a story’s history.

### Contamination

- Change of content to highlight or suppress certain values.

## Story Pattern

Prohibition of something → transgression → punishment → redemption → unity → separation → unity
