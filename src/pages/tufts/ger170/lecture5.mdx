## The Philosopher’s Stone

“Proof by contradiction”: this shows how bad a non-enlightenment leader can be. 

- Mark doesn’t want to work for power. 
- He’s after wealth (via the philosopher’s stone), not knowledge. 
- The philosopher’s stone is an _end goal_, not a process, like the enlightenment. 


## The Fairy Tale

Written during the Enlightenment, at a time when France was invading Germany. 

- People need to be educated on how to live in an enlightened society. 
- Art is useful! The distance of allegory makes people detatched enough to talk about it without being personally attached. 
- Rhein river is the demarkation between France and Germany. 
- The text doesn’t tell us what to do, it’s a weird and hard-to-decipher story that makes you think/discuss with people?
