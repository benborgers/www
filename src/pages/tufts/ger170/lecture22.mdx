- Hermann Hesse lived in the German Empire and won the Nobel Prize in literature in 1946 for his works. 
	- A lot of his tales involve an individual’s search for individuality. 
		- In an “orientalist” way. 
- **Orientalism:** Western culture fabricates a view of Eastern culture as something that’s static and monolithic, rather than as a huge number of dynamic cultures. 
	- There’s no “The East”. People in Europe lump it togeter. 
	- The idea of “The East” implies that it cannot develop without the rationality of “The West”, making it inferior. 
- Hesse fabricates a view of Eastern culture as undeveloped and the West as cultured. *But!* He hates the West, and values his fabricated version of the East over what he sees in Europe. 
	- Hesse took a trip to India and wouldn’t shut up about it. 
- The tales we read were written around World War I (~1918). 
- Hesse didn’t like war, and was very vocal about it. He also wasn’t a fan of the nationalism that was driving the war, which made society around him not like him very much. 
- Hesse pushed back against the Enlightenment.
