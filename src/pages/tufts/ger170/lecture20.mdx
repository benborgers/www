- Rumpelstiltskin is an antisemitic portrayal. 
	- Human-like, but not quite human
		- Hunched over
		- Parts of his face accentuated 
	- Wealth and exchange
		- Values children over wealth, presumably because he already has a lot of wealth
	- Kinda emasculated because he can spin
- **Blood libel**: the antisemitic conspiracy theory that Jews use the blood of Christian children for rituals. 
- Study after study has shown that Jewish people are just as rich as everyone else and have dealt with money as much as anyone else. 
- It doesn’t matter if the Grimms *were* antisemitic or *thought* they were antisemitic, but they took antisemitic action by publishing and distributing these tales. That act made antisemitism more entrenched and natural. 
- In the Grimms’ tales, Christian men are people who *have*  to do things who survive society, but women and Jewish people *are* a certain way, specifically they *are* a way that reveals their nature and therefore *are* a way that deserves punishment. 
	- In some tales, Jewish people are punished specifically because they are synonymous with the trickery. 
		- The Jewish dude *is* a liar. Other guys lie, but “out of necessity.”
	- The fairy tales say this in a matter-of-fact way. 
		- No one in the tale contradicts the antisemitism.
