Moral: arranged marriage, sex, and pregnancy are scary, but better than the alternative of being destitute and without a provider. 

## Green Serpent

Written in 1698, and very influenced by Cupid & Psyche. 

Idea: maybe magic and individual beauty aren’t as important as socially beneficial intelligence.
