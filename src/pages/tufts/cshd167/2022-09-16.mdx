- It’s almost impossible today for parents to restrict children’s use of media. 
- Two schools of thought: 
	- Children are naive and need to be protected. 
	- Children are savvy, so don’t restrict but empower them with media literacy. 
- Assumptions:
	- Children bring less real-world experience to watching media. 
	- Children are very eager to learn, especially in preschool and early elementary ages. 
	- Children have less experience with media features, like ads. 
- By age 2, children: 
	- Recognize that what’s on TV is bounded inside the TV. 
	- Can start to learn from video. 
	- May or may not recognize ads. 
- By ages 3-5, children:
	- Realize what happens on TV doesn’t affect them. 
	- Learn as well from video representations as real life. 
- By ages 6-8, children: 
	- Become more conscious of body image (both boys and girls). 
	- Have preference for peers (real and virtual). 
	- Branch out past TV to other forms of media. 
- Attention, Comprehension, Retention
	- Attention: 
		- Visual and auditory attention
		- As kids get older, they can pay more consistent attention for longer
	- Comprehension: 
		- Children develop a schema of the world in their heads. 
		- Things that break this schema are jarring for children, but over time they get better at incorporating new information. 
	- Retention:
		- How much do children retain from a visual or auditory program? 
- There are lots of contradictory results in correlations between TV and imagination.
