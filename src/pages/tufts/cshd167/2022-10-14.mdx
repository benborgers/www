- Media can be pro-social and improve academics and reading. 
- Content of media is what really counts, not hours spent watching. 
- Sesame Street has been studied more than any other children’s show. 
	- They’ve brought on a character on the Autism spectrum, a character who are food insecure and unhoused, an Asian American character, and a character with an incarcerated parent. 
	- When they do shows in different countries, they bring on a production team from that country to make sure it’s portraying everything correctly and aligns with that country’s educational goals.
