## What is object-oriented programming?

It’s a collection of ideas. 

- Encapsulate code and data
- Abstract data types
	- They hide how they work on the inside
	- “Abstract” = correct behavior, but the inside workings are hidden
- Overloading
	- Changes how an operator works
	- For example, `+` on integers vs. strings
- Inheritance
	- “I want an object just like another, but slightly different” (without copy and pasting)
	- DRY

**People came up with objects because they’re a good model for many things in real life.**

## Java

- One file per class (unlike C++, which has a header file and body file)
- It’s an interpreted language
	- Java → Machine code _for_ Java Virtual Machine → Execute code on the Java Virtual Machine
- Compilation
	- `javac Foo.java` compiles `Foo.class` etc files
	- `java Foo` runs `Foo.class`’s `public static void main` method
