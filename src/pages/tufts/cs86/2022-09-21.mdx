- To terminate program when window closes: `setDefaultCloseOperation(EXIT_ON_CLOSE)` (method on `JFrame`)

This somehow runs code as thread safe (avoid race conditions?): 
```java
public static void main(String [] args) {
	public void run() {
		new Main();
	}
}

MyRun myRun = new MyRun();
java.awt.EventQueue.invokeLater(myRun);
```

or: 

```java
java.awt.EventQueue.invokeLater(new Runnable() {
	public void run() {
		new Main();
	}
});
```


- `BorderLayout`: like Finder, where there’s 1-4 fixed-width border areas and a variable-width content area. 
	- `add(new Border(), BorderLayout.WEST)`
- Nest `JPanel` as much as you’d like (like `<div>`)


## Java

- `public final int = 3;`
	- You can never change this value, it’s a constant
- `public static int = 3;`
	- This applies to all items of the class, and it’s shared and only stored once.
	- Can be called on the class itself without having an instance (`Rect.printCount()`). 
- To compare string *contents*, we do `s1.equals(s2)`.
