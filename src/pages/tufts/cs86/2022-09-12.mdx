- In Java, `Rectangle r1` creates a _pointer_ to a variable of class Rectangle, but `Rectangle r1 = new Rectangle()` creates the real thing. 
- `abstract class` canâ€™t be instantiated, it can only be inherited from. 
- We often store bounding boxes instead of x/y/width/height because it works for all shapes and simplifies calculations. 
- Variables of type `Shape` can hold `Rectangle` or `Circle` at runtime (and this is how you do inheritance). 
	```java
	Shape s1;
	s1 = new Circle();
	```
- `protected` allows sub-classes to access a variable (method), while `private` does not. 
- `abstract public void functionName()` in the parent class givves a heads-up that subclasses provide that function.
