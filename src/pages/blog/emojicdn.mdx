I built an API called [EMOJICDN](https://emojicdn.elk.sh) that lets you pass in any emoji and get a PNG for Apple's artwork of that emoji.

For example: [emojicdn.elk.sh/ðŸ¤©](https://emojicdn.elk.sh/ðŸ¤©)

It uses the Apple versions of the emojis because I think those are the most recognizable and good-looking. 

# Uses

You can also use that link as the source of an `img` html element: 

<img
  src="https://emojicdn.elk.sh/ðŸ¤©"
  style={{
    width: "64px"
  }}
/>

I also often use it as a quick and easy favicon: 

```html
<link rel="icon" href="https://emojicdn.elk.sh/ðŸ¤©" />
```

The source code for the API is [open source](https://github.com/benborgers/emojicdn), and there's more details at [emojicdn.elk.sh](https://emojicdn.elk.sh).
