description: You can get the time that your Gatsby site was last built using Gatsby's GraphQL queries. This can be useful to show visitors how recently the site was built, and how fresh the content is.

import LastBuilt from "../../components/blog/LastBuilt"

If your Gatsby site pulls in data at build time, it can be helpful to show visitors when the site was last built. 

<LastBuilt />

This component relies on a GraphQL query to fetch the build time, and then formats it using a lightweight package called [`tiny-relative-date`](https://npm.im/tiny-relative-date).

Here is the abbreviated component (without styling):

```
import React from "react"
import { useStaticQuery, graphql } from "gatsby"
import relativeDate from "tiny-relative-date"

export default () => {
  const query = useStaticQuery(graphql`
    query {
      site {
        buildTime
      }
    }
  `)

  const buildTime = new Date(query.site.buildTime)
  const buildTimeRelative = relativeDate(buildTime)

  return (
    <p>This site (benborgers.com) was last built {buildTimeRelative}.</p>
  )
}
```
