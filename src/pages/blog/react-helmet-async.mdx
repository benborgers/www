title: How to fix react-helmet "componentWillMount has been renamed" error
description: If you're getting the warning "componentWillMount has been renamed, and is not recommended for use" in React, the culprit may be `react-helmet`. You can easily fix the warning by replacing `react-helmet` with another package, `react-helmet-async`.

I was using the [`react-helmet`](https://npm.im/react-helmet) package, and noticed an error in my console saying: 

> Warning: componentWillMount has been renamed, and is not recommended for use. See https://fb.me/react-async-component-lifecycle-hooks for details.

Turns out, in the next version of React 17 (the next version of React), the `componentWillMount` method will no longer work. `react-helmet` relies on this method, and therefore there's a warning when you try to use `componentWillMount` in React 16.9+.

Theres an [open issue on GitHub](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet/issues/465) for fixing this, but it doesn't look like the NFL (which made `react-helmet`) is actively maintaining the package. 


# Solution

There's a virtually identical package called [`react-helmet-async`](https://npm.im/react-helmet-async), which doesn't have this error and will continue working through React 17. Replacing `react-helmet` with `react-helmet-async` everywhere in my code got rid of the warning for me. 

# Solving it in Gatsby

If your site is built with [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org), you're probably currently using [`gatsby-plugin-react-helmet`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-react-helmet/). You'll need to replace this plugin with [`@rhysforyou/gatsby-plugin-react-helmet-async`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/@rhysforyou/gatsby-plugin-react-helmet-async).
