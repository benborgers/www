Sometimes you've got a development server running on a localhost port in the background that you can't seem to stop. 

For example, if the port is `localhost:8000`, run: 

```
sudo lsof -i :8000
```

You should see the processes running on that port. Take note of the `PID` for these processes. 

Then, run: 

```
kill -9 <PID>
```
