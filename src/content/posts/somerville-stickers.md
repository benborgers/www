Somerville, Massachusetts _(where Tufts University is located)_ has some of the stickiest resident parking permits down to man. They are virtually impossible to remove from a windshield.

(This is [well](https://www.reddit.com/r/Somerville/comments/f7n58t/replacing_parking_permit_sticker/) [documented](https://www.reddit.com/r/Somerville/comments/15vsted/how_do_you_remove_the_previous_year_parking/) [on](https://www.reddit.com/r/Somerville/comments/umtyq2/advice_on_how_to_remove_somerville_parking_sticker/) [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Somerville/comments/thyfb0/best_way_to_remove_old_parking_permits_from/).)

When walking around Somerville, you may start to notice the resulting carnage. And once you see it, you can't un-see it.

Here are some examples from this past year:

1. The _"gave it a good attempt"_

2. The _"immediate nope"_ (they started peeling at the top-left corner, and then gave up)

3. The _"fool me twice"_ (note the small sprinkles of pulverized parking sticker on the dash; then the new one has been taped over to make it non-sticky and is manually taped up with weak tape)

4. The _"minimal-effort fool me twice"_ (same as above, but didn't even take off the backing paper)

5. The _"fool me ~~twice~~, shame on me"_
