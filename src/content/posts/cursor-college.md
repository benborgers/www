I don't think it makes sense to teach agentic coding in college.

I graduated from college this past May. Our curriculum was taught entirely in C++ and C.

Not because they expect us to really ever use it! But because Computer Science is a field that is, at least for now, moving quickly enough that the specific details of anything they teach you in college will soon become outdated.

They don't even teach *React* in college. And I don't particularly think they should!

What they teach is fundamental academic Computer Science, not the zoomed-in practical things in particular, but the things that have a chance at being useful for your **entire** career. React, dominant and wonderful as it is, may very well not be dominant for my entire career.

Learning C++ and C was not an *end*, but a *means to an end*. And the real outcome — fundamental understanding of Computer Science concepts — will hopefully be relevant long-term despite radical change in the industry.

And what *certainly* won't be relevant for decades is **"how to best use Cursor today *(gpt-5-codex and sonnet-4.5 edition)*"**.

The way that I use AI for coding today is *hugely different* from the way I used it last summer. Or even at the beginning of *this* summer. Any attempt to teach Cursor in college would boil down to a bag of prompting techniques and mental models for today's models, but not necessarily for tomorrow's.

The landscape is changing too fast to be encapsulated in a college course that's supposed to last a student for a long time. ChatGPT didn't exist when I started college four years ago; Cursor only appeared in the latter half of my time in college.

A course on agentic coding would probably be popular, yes, but short-sighted.

(I don't really know what a "one day class" is — it sounds like something that a university couldn't represent within the on-prem Oracle software that powered our course schedules — but a *club meeting* for those interested in agentic coding seems perfectly fine. But be wary of [making it boring](/interestingness).)
