title: "How I would have picked my college classes, in retrospect"
draft: true

In retrospect, I would have taken very different classes.

I graduated from Tufts University last month with two majors, Computer Science and Engineering Psychology, and one minor, in German. I also kept a [catalog](https://tufts.ben.page) of all the classes that I took.

Tufts' majors are small — you could complete the Computer Science major in 3 semesters, if you really wanted to. So what do you do with the other 5 semesters?

In sophomore year, I added Engineering Psychology on top of my original Computer Science major and German minor. I needed something to fill up the copious empty space in my coming years, and the Engineering Psychology major fit just barely.

It was another ladder to climb, another list of checkboxes to check. When I brought the idea to my advisor, Sam Sommers, he told me to keep an open mind about stopping at any time: the difference between someone who was an Engineering Psychology double major and someone who took a lot of Engineering Psychology classes but stopped is not significant.

Perhaps it also makes sense to describe what Engineering Psychology is. It's similar to Human Factors Engineering or Ergonomics, if that means anything to you.

It's the study of how people interact with technology — mostly physical, since that's the era the field came out of. How to design airplane cockpits to reduce confusion, factory machines to reduce accidents, and software to reduce frustration.

I did not learn very much in Engineering Psychology. But I did complete the major.

It was a train of classes which all seemed to overlap and which contained half-baked enthusiasm for (what felt like) an utter lack of substance. Half of the things we covered seemed to me to be common sense, or dumb, and the other half was covered in the first couple chapters of Don Norman's *The Design of Everyday Things*. (Perhaps they were covered more later in the book as well; I did not ever finish the book, so I would not know.)

I hope that none of my Engineering Psychology classmates are reading this essay. But I truly could not fathom that some people majored exclusively in this stuff. What do you possibly learn over the course of four years?
