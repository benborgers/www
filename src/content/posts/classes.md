title: How I would have picked my college class, in retrospect
draft: true

I graduated from Tufts University last month with two majors, Computer Science and Engineering Psychology, and one minor, in German. I also [catalogued](https://tufts.ben.page) all the classes I took, if you're curious.

Tufts' majors are small â€” you could complete the Computer Science major in 3 semesters, if you really wanted to. So what do you do with the other 5 semesters?

Some of that is taken up by the _liberal arts_ requirements, but the small majors encourages many Tufts students to double-major.
