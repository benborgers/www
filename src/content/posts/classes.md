title: "How I would have picked my classes, in retrospect"
draft: true

In retrospect, I would have taken different classes.

I graduated from Tufts University this May with two majors, Computer Science and Engineering Psychology, and one minor, in German. I also kept a [catalog](https://tufts.ben.page) of all the classes that I took.

Tufts' majors are small — you could complete the Computer Science major in 3 semesters, if you really wanted to. So what do you do with the other 5 semesters?

In sophomore year, I added Engineering Psychology on top of my original Computer Science major and German minor. I needed something to fill up the copious empty space in my coming years, and the Engineering Psychology major fit just barely.

It was another ladder to climb, another list of checkboxes to check. When I brought the idea to my advisor, Sam Sommers, he told me to keep an open mind about stopping at any time: the difference between someone who was an Engineering Psychology double major and someone who took a lot of Engineering Psychology classes but stopped is not significant.

I should also explain what Engineering Psychology is. It's similar to Human Factors Engineering or Ergonomics, if that means anything to you.

It's the study of how people interact with technology — mostly physical, since that's the era the field came out of. How to design airplane cockpits to reduce confusion, factory machines to reduce accidents, and software to reduce frustration.

I did not learn very much in Engineering Psychology. And I did take all the classes for the major.

It was a train of classes which all seemed to overlap and which contained half-baked enthusiasm for (what felt like) an utter lack of substance. Half of the things we covered seemed to me to be common sense, or dumb, and the other half was covered in the first couple chapters of Don Norman's *The Design of Everyday Things*. (Perhaps they were covered more later in the book as well; I did not ever finish the book, so I would not know.)

I hope that none of my Engineering Psychology classmates are reading this essay. But I truly could not fathom that some people majored exclusively in this stuff. What do you possibly learn over the course of four years?

Anyway, I did not heed Sam Sommers' advice. My brain loves checklists, and loves completing checklists. A second major was a fantastic checklist.

But what I gained in a happy, smooth brain, I lost in opportunity cost. Engineering Psychology just *barely* fit into my 8 semesters at Tufts. It left no space for interesting random Computer Science courses, or humanities courses, or anything else.

Engineering Psychology was interesting, but not *15 courses* interesting. If I was picking again, I'd opt for less checklists, and more random interesting-sounding picks.
