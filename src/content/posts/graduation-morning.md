I graduated three days ago from [Tufts](https://tufts.ben.page).

On the morning of graduation, at 6:40am, I felt compelled to take a walk around campus with my camera.

I found:

1. The main stage being set up

2. The cannon, usually painted by students, being covered with a thick coat of black paint

3. Each of the thousands of chairs being meticulously wiped to get rid of the small puddle of rainwater that collected on each chair overnight
