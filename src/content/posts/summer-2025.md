It turns out that I am bad at regularly writing updates. But since it's fall now (!!) I will write an update for the summer:

In early July, I moved into an apartment in Fenway in Boston. It's a one bedroom apartment; my first time living without roommates or housemates. I somewhat miss the feeling of living with other people, but having one's own space is also glorious. Nowhere is this more evident than the kitchen: I get to rule the space all by myself, and for better or for worse, everything is exactly where I left it.

At almost the same time, I started working at [Owner](https://owner.com). It's been a long time coming — I signed my offer back in early October — but I had to graduate from college first.

Owner has been great as well. I've been given a whole piece of the product that I can run with. The whole reason I joined Owner was for this kind of ownership, while being surrounded by people I could learn from.

When I first signed my offer, Owner's engineering team was around 15 people. By the time I joined, it was around 40. More people to learn from, which is wonderful, and my team also has a bit more of the Wild West startup spirit that I enjoy.

The cliche is right: time is going fast. In early September, people I know started going back to college, and I couldn't believe that it had already been an entire summer's worth of time between graduation and September. Now, it's one month later than that.

It's not unexpected, but I was caught off guard nonetheless. When your days are similar — not boring, but similar — time blends together.

I'm still working at [Buttondown](https://buttondown.com), which is also quite enjoyable, and Owner and Buttondown together fill my time. Maybe I should find some other fun and novel things to do, in an attempt to slow down time; perhaps something other than sitting in the Boston Public Library and tinkering with my personal website.

Anyway — thanks for reading, and until next time. (I make no promises for when that will be.)
