It turns out that I am bad at regularly writing updates. But since it's fall now (!!) I will write an update for the summer.

The three big things that have happened since I wrote that last update are that I moved, started a job post-grad, and that Trisha has started dental school.

## Moving to Fenway

## Working at Owner

## Trisha the dentist
