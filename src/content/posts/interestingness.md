title: Make sure your university events are actually interesting

One of the biggest things I've learned from running [JumboCode](/jumbocode) this year is to **make sure you aren't lying to yourself about how interesting something is**.

## University clubs organize boring events

University clubs often organize events that _sound_ good, but that aren't actually interesting. The student organizers **know** that they wouldn't go to this event themselves if they weren't organizing it.

But they somehow suspend disbelief, going through the motions of planning an event that feels like what they _should_ be doing.

That's how clubs end up doing "speed-friending," or a panel discussion with software engineers and free pizza. In reality, I think people have very little interest in talking to random people or attending an hour-long Q&A.

## The bar for interestingness needs to be high

Going to an event in college requires significant activation energy.

The alternative is to stay in my bedroom, which is quite comfortable, and to forego doing my homework, which I really need to do.

Many events _sound_ good in advance, but when it becomes 6pm on a Sunday night and I haven't finished my homework for the weekend yet — is it _actually_ compelling enough to go?

## What JumboCode has done in the past

JumboCode has a weekly meeting with our 12 teams, 170 members, all in a big room. We call this _Hack Night_.

In the past, Hack Night has often consisted of activities that I would classify as _sounding good but not actually compelling_. For example:

- Bingo, where you find people with traits and try to fill up your bingo board
- Being put into random groups of 3 people to chat about how your project is going
- Hearing a monotonous presentation about someone's summer internship
- Hearing a monotonous presentation about web security

## What I've done with JumboCode this year

I don't claim that we've done anything groundbreaking this year, but I've tried to be as ruthless as possible about keeping Hack Night interesting. As a result, Hack Night has been ~2x as well attended.

People need a reason to get out of bed and come to Hack Night on Sunday nights.

So I've started inventing games for us to play, as a way of helping the teams open up:

- Jeopardy, where members buzz in from their phones
- Team-based Geoguessr (using an app that I built myself)
- Building the tallest tower out of paper and tape
- Scribbl.io where each team is a player

I try to pick things that will:

1. Engage all 100+ people in the room, not just a few players
2. Be _actually fun_ in a not-cringy way
3. Be done quickly

### Be done quickly

It's ugly to admit, but our attention spans are short — mine included.

I can _see_ people become antsy when something drags on for too lon. So I try to make sure that the activities move quickly, that everything's set up from the beginning, and that we end at a high point that leaves people wanting more.

Once, I cut off an activity that I felt was dragging on too long and experienced an audible groan from people who wanted to continue playing. That was ideal. If people are _feeling_ that it's time to be done, you've gone too far.

## Don't lie to yourself

The bar for what is _actually_ interesting and compelling enough to get someone to a university event — without compulsion — is high.

As students, we _know_ this. But we somehow often forget when *planning* events that the events we plan need to meet that same high bar.

Don't just nod along to a mediocre idea when it comes up in discussion. Interrogate it and see whether _you_ would actually attend.
