*For reference, the manual is [here](https://download.8bitdo.com/Manual/Controller/Zero2/Zero2_Manual.pdf).*

1. To turn on the controller, press R + Start together. The blue light should blink in sets of 5.
   1. If it's already turned on, hold Start to turn it off.
1. Hold the Select button to go into pairing mode. The blue light should start blinking rapidly.
1. Go to your computer's bluetooth settings and pair with the 8BitDo controller.
1. Download [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/), an app that lets you remap one key to actually mean another key.
1. By default, the 8BitDo outputs certain letters (a, b, c, etc) when you press buttons. In Karabiner-Elements, under Simple Modifications, you can set up a certain letter outputted by your 8BitDo to mean another keyboard shortcut (for example, one that corresponds to an Anki keyboard shortcut).
   1. To figure out which buttons output which letters, just open any text input on your computer and press the keys to figure out which one is which.
