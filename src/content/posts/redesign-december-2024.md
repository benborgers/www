I redesign my website 2-3 times per year.

I do it at all times of year, but I always seem to be redesigning around Christmas: in 2021, [2022](/redesign-december-2022), 2023, and 2024.

There's versions in between these screenshots too, but I seem to always find myself tinkering with my website on [winter break](/winter23).

And this winter break is no different! I started in the airport on the way to Charleston, South Carolina, and I have pushed it live from Charleston a day and a half later.
