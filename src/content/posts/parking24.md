Embarrassingly, I got enough parking tickets in 2024 to warrant a Parking Tickets Wrapped.

## April 25

**Amount:** $30

**Reason:** Parking facing the wrong direction near Davis Square in Somerville.

**My Defense:** The street is so narrow that you can't even fit more than 1 car at a time. It's ridiculous that it's a 2-way street in the first place. How was I to know that you can't just pull onto the left side if there's an open spot?

## May 1

**Amount:** $50

**Reason:** Parking on the wrong side during street cleaning in Somerville.

**My Defense:** This stretch of road [didn't have a street cleaning sign](/posts/parking24/IMG_5831.jpg)! The sign was ripped down at some point and then it disappeared! I disputed this but I don't think my images got properly uploaded to their portal, and my dispute was rejected. The next step was to go to Middlesex County Court, which I would have _loved_ to do, but alas I was flying to Germany imminently.

## June 4

**Amount:** $15

**Reason:** Failing to pay the meter outside Caff√® Nero in Arlington.

**My Defense:** None. At least Arlington tickets are cheap?

## June 5

**Amount:** $50

**Reason:** Honestly I have no recollection of this ticket. Maybe that says something.

**My Defense:** None.

## Oct 25

**Amount:** $93 + $90 = $183

**Reason:** Parked in Boston near Newbury Street that doesn't allow parking from _4-6pm_ specifically, and didn't read the sign properly. Was towed promptly at 4:09pm ($93) and ticketed on top of it ($90).

**My Defense:** What kind of revenue trap is a spot that allows parking at all times except 4-6pm? However, I'm happy to contribute to the beautiful city of Boston.

## November 4

**Amount:** $50

**Reason:** Parking on the wrong side during street cleaning in Somerville.

**My Defense:** I was parking on a different street than usual and forgot to check the street cleaning days there.

## November 30

**Amount:** ~~$50~~ $0

**Reason:** Parking in a bike lane at Assembly Row in Somerville.

**My Defense:** I'm not sure whether that was a legal parking spot (although there were other cars in the same stretch), but there was _definitely_ no bike lane there. I took many pictures and disputed with the City of Somerville. My images _again_ didn't get uploaded, but I called them and had someone attach my images. I won the dispute!

## Total

All in all: $378. Honestly not as bad as I would've thought. But here's to hoping for less tickets in 2025.
