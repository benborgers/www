Based on when I was still in college until last year: **Every student is cheating with AI**. 

- When I was a computer science TA, it was clear that tons of students were using ChatGPT to do the assignments and coming to office hours only when that failed them. 
- There were certain computer science classes (Web Programming) where essentially *everyone* was turning in exactly what ChatGPT gave them. 
- In group projects, everyone was passing off AI writing as their own, with [varying levels of quality](/chatgpt-semester). 
- In language classes, people were turning in homework and essays that were heavily *assisted* by ChatGPT. 

I'm not here to condemn these behaviors — in fact, depending on the statute of limitations, I may have been an offender as well.
