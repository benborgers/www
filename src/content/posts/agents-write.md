I recently realized that 90% of the code I write for work is written by coding agents like [Claude Code](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code) or [Amp](https://ampcode.com/).

I wouldn't describe it as "vibe coding" —&nbsp;I'm guiding the implementation of everything that goes in pretty closely, and ask for all sorts of pedantic tweaks — but the actual *typing* of the code is largely something I no longer do.
