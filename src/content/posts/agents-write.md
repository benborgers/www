I recently realized that 90% of the code I write for work is written by coding agents like [Claude Code](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code) or [Amp](https://ampcode.com/).

I wouldn't describe it as "vibe coding" —&nbsp;I'm guiding the implementation of everything that goes in pretty closely, and ask for all sorts of pedantic tweaks — but the actual *typing* of the code is largely something that I no longer do.

I think the switch happened at some point in the last 6 months, but I'm not 100% sure. For a long time, I would use [Cursor Tab](https://cursor.com/docs/tab/overview) to suggest code inline as I was writing. I would also pose questions to the agent on specific chunks of code, using `cmd+k`, whenever I needed it.

But today, I find myself writing very little code by hand. Instead, I'm directing the agent to make edits. Most of the time, editing code by hand just feels like a slower way of manipulating text — like foregoing multi-cursor editing, or coding without IntelliSense.

Coding agents can manipulate text much faster than I can. Even though I'm still leading the implementation, it feels like a waste of time not to let the coding agent do the typing.
