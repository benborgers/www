title: "We built JumboSmash, a dating app for Tufts seniors"
draft: true

On May 8th, some friends and I launched *JumboSmash*, a dating (*"dating"*) app for Tufts seniors during the last week before graduation.

JumboSmash is a 10-year tradition, and to contribute to future generations, I thought I'd write down my thoughts before I *totally* forget them.
