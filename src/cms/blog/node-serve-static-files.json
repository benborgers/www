  "body": "If you have a folder of static files and want to serve them using Node.js, you can use a package called `serve-handler`. \n\nFirst, install the package: \n\n```bash\nnpm install serve-handler\n```\n\nThen, here's an example of how to use it to create a static file server: \n\n```javascript\nconst serveHandler = require('serve-handler')\nconst http = require('http') // comes pre-installed with Node.js\n\nhttp.createServer((req, res) => serveHandler(req, res, {\n  public: 'path/to/folder' // folder of files to serve\n})).listen(8000)\n```\n\nNow, if you run this Node.js script, you'll have a static file server at `localhost:8000`. \n\nThere are more options for `serve-handler` (other than `public`) in [the documentation](http://npm.im/serve-handler).",
