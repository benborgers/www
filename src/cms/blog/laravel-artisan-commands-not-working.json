  "slug": "laravel-artisan-commands-not-working",
  "body": "I just created a new Laravel app and installed Jetstream, and when I went to run `php artisan serve` it hung and didn't do anything. \n\nThen, I tried to run `php artisan migrate`, and it also stalled for a while before giving me an error that the database connection had timed out. \n\nThis was weird, because it was a completely fresh installation of Laravel and Jetstream with no changes made. \n\nI eventually realized that the issue lay in the `.env` file. The new Laravel installation has a `.env` file with these values: \n\n```\nDB_CONNECTION=mysql\n# DB_HOST=127.0.0.1\nDB_HOST=mysql\nDB_PORT=3306\nDB_DATABASE=laravel\nDB_USERNAME=root\nDB_PASSWORD=\n```\n\nThe `DB_HOST` variable is no longer set to localhost, like it used to be, but my local MySQL database for development is running at `localhost:3306` (which is the same as `127.0.0.1:3306`). \n\nTo fix it, all I had to do was uncomment the first `DB_HOST` line by removing the `#`, and then remove the line that says `DB_HOST=mysql`. \n\nNow, `php artisan serve` and `php artisan migrate` worked perfectly again.
