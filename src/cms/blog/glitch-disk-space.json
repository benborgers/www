  "slug": "glitch-disk-space",
  "description": "While saving data to the filesystem in a Glitch project, I kept running out of disk space because Glitch was saving every change as a git commit. I solved the issue by running a couple git commands automatically on my server to clean up old commits. ",
  "body": "Since originally writing this blog post, I've since found that the best way to solve a problem like this is to add the database file(s) to your `.gitignore` file. \n\nThis tells git not to keep a record of changes to your database, which avoids clogging up your disk space with local git history."
