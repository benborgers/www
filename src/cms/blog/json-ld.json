  "body": "I want the title, description, and publish date to be really clear when Google looks at my blog posts. After some searching, I decided to add metadata to my articles in the JSON-LD format.\n\nJSON-LD is a specific set of data that you often add to the `<head>` of your blog post, which hidden metadata about your page.\n\nI did a bunch of fiddling with Google's [structured data testing tool](https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool/), and finally landed on adding this to the blog post template of my Gatsby blog:\n\n```html\n<script type=\"application/ld+json\">\n  {\n    \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \n    \"@type\": \"BlogPosting\",\n    \"headline\": \"How to use JSON-LD to improve SEO on a developer blog\",\n    \"image\": \"https://benborgers.com/assets/json-ld.png\",\n    \"publisher\": {\n      \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n      \"name\": \"Ben Borgers\",\n      \"url\": \"https://benborgers.com\",\n      \"logo\": {\n        \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n        \"url\": \"https://benborgers.com/assets/index.png\",\n        \"width\": \"1200\",\n        \"height\": \"630\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"url\": \"https://benborgers.com/blog/json-ld/\",\n    \"datePublished\": \"2020-01-06T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"dateCreated\": \"2020-01-06T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"dateModified\": \"2020-01-06T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"description\": \"Adding data to your developer blog in the JSON-LD format, like the title, description, share image, author, and date published, can make it easier for Google to parse and index your articles.\",\n    \"author\": {\n      \"@type\": \"Person\",\n      \"name\": \"Ben Borgers\",\n      \"url\": \"https://benborgers.com\"\n    },\n    \"mainEntityOfPage\": {\n      \"@type\": \"WebPage\",\n      \"@id\": \"https://benborgers.com/blog/\"\n    }\n  }\n</script>\n```\n\nMost of the lines are fairly self-explanatory:\n\n- Defining that the page is a blog post (type \"BlogPosting\")\n- Defining the title, description, and share image for the page\n- Recording dates when the blog post was published, created, and modified\n\nGoogle's testing tool also complained that I didn't have an author and a publisher, so I added both.\n\nThe `mainEntityOfPage` property defines what this page is an \"entity\", or part, of. In my case, these blog posts are a part of my larger blog.\n\nAdding this script tag to the blog post template of my Gatsby blog has allowed Google to more easily parse and index my articles."
