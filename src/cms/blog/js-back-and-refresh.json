  "body": "Let's say you want to have a link that sends the user back one page, but also refreshes the page so that last page's content isn't stale. \n\nHere's a way you can do it: \n\n```javascript\n// On button press, or something else: \ndocument.referrer ? window.location = document.referrer : history.back()\n```\n\nThis looks to see if we have a `referrer`, which is the last page that the user came from before this page. If there is, we navigate to that page. \n\nIf there isn't, we fall back to using `history.back()` as an alternative, which sends the user back _without_ refreshing. ",
