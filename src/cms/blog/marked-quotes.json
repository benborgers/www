  "body": "Marked.js is a library for parsing Markdown into HTML. \n\nI personally think that curly or \"smart\" quotes look better in writing, like this: \n\n```text\n\"straight quotes\"\n“curly quotes”\nstraight apostrophe: they're\ncurly apostrophe: they’re\n```\n\nTo turn straight quotes into curly quotes when parsing with Marked.js, use the `setOptions` function to turn \"smartypants\" rendering on: \n\n```javascript\nmarked.setOptions({ smartypants: true })\n\nmarked.parse(/* markdown content */)\n```\n\nNow, running `marked.parse` will produce HTML with intelligently replaced curly quotes.
