  "description": "I include the og:type, og:site_name, og:title, og:description, and og:image meta tags in my Gatsby sites using a reusable \"Head\" component. You could also add equivalent twitter:* tags, but Twitter falls back on og:* tags, so there's no need to include both.",
  "body": "In almost every Gatsby site I make, I create a `<Head />` component with all the meta tags I'll need. I reuse that component on every page, passing in different titles and descriptions.\n\nThere's definitely more meta tags you could use, but I've whittled it down to this component:\n\n```jsx\nimport React from \"react\"\nimport { Helmet } from \"react-helmet\"\n\nexport default ({ title, description, shareImage }) => {\n  return (\n    <Helmet>\n      <title>{title}</title>\n      <meta name=\"description\" content={description} />\n\n      <meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"website\" />\n      <meta property=\"og:site_name\" content=\"My Site\" />\n      <meta property=\"og:title\" content={title} />\n      <meta property=\"og:description\" content={description} />\n      <meta property=\"og:image\" content={shareImage} />\n\n      <meta property=\"twitter:card\" content=\"summary_large_image\" />\n\n      <link rel=\"icon\" href=\"/link/to/favicon.png\" />\n    </Helmet>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## A couple notes\n\n- There's some repeats (`title` and `og:title`, `description` and `og:description`), but since this is a reusable component it isn't really more work to include both.\n- The `og:image` is quite important to me, because a nice share image makes the link stand out when it's shared on Twitter or elsewhere.\n- The `twitter:card` tag tells Twitter to make the share image as large as possible in a tweet.\n- You can also add equivalent `twitter:title` etc tags, but Twitter falls back on `og:` tags, so there's no need to include both."
