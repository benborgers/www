  "body": "CORS is a browser feature that blocks HTTP requests from one domain to another, unless the destination has the proper headers set up. \n\nI recently ran into these problems when making an HTTP request from my website to [Potion](https://github.com/benborgers/potion), an API I build for [Notion](https://notion.so) notes. \n\nI fixed it by adding headers to my [Vercel](https://vercel.com) deployment that allowed HTTP requests from any domain. \n\nHere's my `now.json` (or `vercel.json`) file: \n\n```json\n{\n  \"headers\": [\n    {\n      \"source\": \"/(.*)\",\n      \"headers\": [\n        {\n          \"key\": \"access-control-allow-origin\",\n          \"value\": \"*\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"
