  "slug": "js-remove-hash",
  "description": "If you set location.hash to an empty string, there's still a # in the URL. You can use history.replaceState() to get rid of the \"hash\" symbol left over in the URL. ",
  "body": "You usually clear the URL hash like this: \n\n```jsx\nlocation.hash = \"\"\n```\n\nHowever, that leaves a `#` at the end of the URL. You can remove the `#` by adding a line of code: \n\n```jsx\nlocation.hash = \"\"\nhistory.replaceState(\"\", \"\", location.pathname)\n```\n\nThe second line overwrites the URL with the current URL, minus the `#`."
