This can be jarring and might not fit with the rest of your website, so you can use CSS to remove it.\n\nHere's how you remove it: \n\n```css\n* {\n  -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent;\n}\n```\n\nHowever, this might cause the user not to realize that they tapped something. I like to fix this by using javascript to fading out tapped items to 50% opacity. That way, the user realizes that the button's been tapped and that we're loading the next page. "
