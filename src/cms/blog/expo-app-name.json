  "slug": "expo-app-name",
  "description": "Run the CLI command again but with the --app-name argument. This changes the name of your iOS app on App Store Connect, but doesn't change its name when installed on people's home screens. ",
  "body": "So you run `expo upload:ios` and get this error: \n\n> The app name you entered is already being used. If you have trademark rights to this name and would like it released for your use, submit a claim.\n\n![](/assets/expo-app-already-exists.png)\n\nWhat's going on here is that the Apple App Store doesn't allow multiple apps with the same name. \n\nYou need to upload the app again to App Store Connect, but using a different name (this is why you see a lot of apps called \"Shine: Calm Anxiety & Stress\", instead of \"Shine\"). \n\nYou don't need to change the app's name in your `app.json` file though. This means that your app's name on people's home screens will stay the same as you defined in `app.json`. \n\nTo change only the name of the app in the App Store, and not on the home screen, run this command instead: \n\n```bash\nexpo upload:ios --app-name \"My App - Unique Name\"\n```"
