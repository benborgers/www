It's useful for making sure that your CSS looks the same, everywhere. \n\nTo add it to your Gatsby site, first install the package: \n\n```\nnpm install normalize.css\n```\n\nThen, import the stylesheet to any Gatsby page you want to use it on: \n\n```\nimport React from \"react\"\n\nimport \"normalize.css\"\n\nexport default () => {\n  return (\n    <div>the page is here</div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nAdding normalize.css to one page of your Gatsby site is enough.
