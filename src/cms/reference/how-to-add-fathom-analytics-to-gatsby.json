  "body": "[Fathom](https://usefathom.com) offers simple and privacy-focused analytics. This method works with Fathom v1 or v2, since the tracking code on your website is the same for both versions. \n\nIf you want to start to collect analytics using Fathom on a Gatsby site, you can't just copy and paste the tracking script Gatsby provides into your pages. Since Gatsby navigates to new pages without refreshing the whole page, it won't track a visitor going to pages beyond the first time the site loads. \n\nLuckily, there's a plugin that solves this problem. The plugin integrates with your Gatsby site and tracks additional page views every time the visitor navigates to a new page. \n\nFirst, create a new site in the Fathom dashboard. Ignore and close the window with the embed code, and then copy the Tracking ID for this new site. \n\nTo use it, install the NPM package via the command line: \n\n```\nnpm install gatsby-plugin-fathom\n```\n\nThen, add the plugin to your `gatsby-config.js`: \n\n```\n// gatsby-config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  plugins: [\n    {\n      resolve: \"gatsby-plugin-fathom\",\n      options: {\n        // trackingUrl is only necessary if you're self-hosting Fathom, otherwise this defaults to the hosted version of Fathom\n        trackingUrl: \"your-fathom-instance.com\",\n        // this is the Tracking ID you copied earlier\n        siteId: \"ABCDEFGH\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThat's it! You won't see Fathom tracking code in the development version of your Gatsby site (when you run `gatsby develop`), but the tracking code will get inserted into the production mode of your website (when you run `gatsby build`).
