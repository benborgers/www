## Getting Started

To work on this site, run:

```bash
npm run serve

This creates a server at `localhost:3000` that rebuilds the site every second.


## Extended Markdown in Garden

The `garden/` directory allows for extended markdown syntax:

- `[[connection-to-other/page]]` or `[[connection-to-other/page, override that pageâ€™s frontmatter title as the link text]]`
- `$$latex$$`
- `==highlighted text==`
